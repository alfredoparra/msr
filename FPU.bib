  Abstract                 = {Decision-theoretic agents predict and evaluate the results of their actions using a model,
or ontology, of their environment. An agent???s goal, or utility function, may also be
specified in terms of the states of, or entities within, its ontology. If the agent may
upgrade or replace its ontology, it faces a crisis: the agent???s original goal may not be
well-defined with respect to its new ontology. This crisis must be resolved before the
agent can make plans towards achieving its goals.
We discuss in this paper which sorts of agents will undergo ontological crises and
why we may want to create such agents. We present some concrete examples, and argue
that a well-defined procedure for resolving ontological crises is needed. We point to
some possible approaches to solving this problem, and evaluate these methods on our
examples.},

We surveyed many professional philosophers in order to help determine their views
on thirty central philosophical issues. This article documents the results. It also
reveals correlations among philosophical views and between these views and factors
such as age, gender, and nationality. A factor analysis suggests that an individual???s
views on these issues factor into a few underlying components that predict much
of the variation in those views. The results of a metasurvey also suggest that
many of the results of the survey are surprising: philosophers as a whole have quite
inaccurate beliefs about the distribution of philosophical views in the profession.},

  Abstract                 = {Computer programs to nd formal proofs of theorems have a history going back nearly
half a century. Originally designed as tools for mathematicians, modern applications of
automated theorem provers and proof assistants are much more diverse. In particular they
are used in formal methods to verify software and hardware designs to prevent costly, or
life threatening, errors being introduced into systems from microchips to controllers for
medical equipment or space rockets.
Despite this, the high level of human expertise required in their use means that theorem proving tools are not widely used by non specialists, in contrast to computer algebra
packages which also deal with the manipulation of symbolic mathematics. The work described in this dissertation addresses one aspect of this problem, that of heuristic selection
in automated theorem provers. In theory such theorem provers should be automatic and
therefore easy to use; in practice the heuristics used in the proof search are not universally
optimal for all problems so human expertise is required to determine heuristic choice and
to set parameter values.
Modern machine learning has been applied to the automation of heuristic selection in
a first order logic theorem prover. One objective was to nd if there are any features
of a proof problem that are both easy to measure and provide useful information for
determining heuristic choice. Another was to determine and demonstrate a practical
approach to making theorem provers truly automatic.
In the experimental work, heuristic selection based on features of the conjecture to
be proved and the associated axioms is shown to do better than any single heuristic.
Additionally a comparison has been made between static features, measured prior to the
proof search process, and dynamic features that measure changes arising in the early stages
of proof search. Further work was done on determining which features are important,
demonstrating that good results are obtained with only a few features required.},

The account is developed for the class of combinatorial-state automata, but is sufficiently general to cover all other discrete computational formalisms. The implementation relation is non-vacuous, so that criticisms by Searle and others fail. This account of computation can be extended to justify the foundational role of computation in artificial intelligence and cognitive science.},

we examine ultraintelligent reinforcement learning agents. Reinforcement
learning can only be used in the real world to define agents whose
goal is to maximize expected rewards, and since this goal does not
match with human goals, AGIs based on reinforcement learning will of-
ten work at cross-purposes to us. To solve this problem, we define value
learners, agents that can be designed to learn and maximize any ini-
tially unknown utility function so long as we provide them with an idea
of what constitutes evidence about that utility function.},

  Abstract                 = {The strong version of Artificial Life claim that emergent computational patterns may not simply simulate life but realize the very phenomenon. This is one of several reasons why a definition of life is of interest. In this paper, it is argued that the received view of definitions of life in biology and philosophy is misleading. Generality cannot in general be dispensed with. Though criteria for adequacy of definitions are highly context-dependent, definitions of life are of a special nature, belonging to what is here called ontodefinitions. Separate definitions of life fulfilling a set of relevant criteria exist and belong to distinct paradigms of theoretical biology. Emergence is implicit in these. The paper investigates if emergence entails `downward causation' (several kinds are defined), and asks if computational models can represent higher orders of emergence. Finally, a comment is made on the role of Wittgenstein's philosophy in understanding the nature of explanation and definition in science.},

  Abstract                 = {The main challenge of automated theorem proving is to find a way to shorten the
search process. Therefore using a good heuristic method is essential. Although there are
several heuristics that improve the search techniques, studies show that a single heuristic
cannot cope with all type of problems. The nature of theorem proving problems makes
it impossible to find the best universal heuristic, since each problem requires a different
search approach. Choosing the right heuristic for a given problem is a difficult task even
for an human expert. Machine learning techniques were applied successfully to construct
a heuristic in several studies. Instead of constructing a heuristic from scratch, we propose
to use the mixture of experts technique to combine the existing heuristics and construct a
heuristic. Since each problem requires a different approach, our method uses the output data
of a similar problem while learning the heuristic for each new problem. The results show
that the combined heuristic is better than each individual heuristic used in combination.},

  Abstract                 = {Today, human-level machine intelligence is in
the domain of futurism, but there is every reason to expect that it will be developed eventu-
ally. Once articial agents become able to improve themselves further, they may far surpass
human intelligence, making it vitally important
to ensure that the result of an \intelligence explosion" is aligned with human interests. In this
paper, we discuss one aspect of this challenge:
ensuring that the initial agent's reasoning about
its future versions is reliable, even if these future versions are far more intelligent than the
current reasoner. We refer to reasoning of this
sort as Vingean reflection.
A self-improving agent must reason about the
behavior of its smarter successors in abstract
terms, since if it could predict their actions in
detail, it would already be as smart as them.
This is called the
Vingean principle, and we argue that theoretical work on Vingean reflection should focus on formal models that reflect this principle. However, the framework of expected
utility maximization, commonly used to model
rational agents, fails to do so. We review a body
of work which instead investigates agents that
use formal proofs to reason about their succes-
sors. While it is unlikely that real-world agents
would base their behavior entirely on formal
proofs, this appears to be the best currently
available formal model of abstract reasoning,
and work in this setting may lead to insights ap-
plicable to more realistic approaches to Vingean
reflection.},

  Abstract                 = {This article is an informal introduction to the concept of supervenience and the role it plays in the philosophy of mind. It surveys some of the many ways the concept has been used to reveal the manner and degree to which mental phenomena depend on facts about our bodies and their physical features. Philosophers usually construe the supervenience relation as a relation between classes of properties, where a class of properties, F, supervenes on a class of properties, G, just in case there is no difference in F-properties without some difference in G-properties. As David Lewis puts it, ???no difference of one sort without differences of another sort??? (1986, p. 14). It is in the philosophy of mind that we find the term???s most frequent contemporary occurrence.

The goal of asking whether one set of properties supervenes on another is to better understand the ontological relation between the two sets ??? especially, whether the one set of properties depends entirely on the other. Suppose, for example, that two individuals can have different moral properties while being exactly alike in terms of their actual and potential behavior; that is, suppose that one???s moral features do not supervene on one???s behavioral features. Then we can conclude that the former depend on something more than the latter. And if we accept this conclusion, we are then led to search for a set of properties on which our moral features do supervene, a set of properties in terms of which any two individuals must differ with any moral difference. The goal is to isolate just that set of features on which our moral properties do wholly rely.

Suppose we succeed in identifying a set of features on which F-properties supervene (where F-properties might be moral, mental, aesthetic, economic, or any other higher-level properties). Then we can try to discover the nature of the dependence of F-properties on the underlying G-properties (for example, behavioral, physical, neurological, or intrinsic) by asking about the manner in which the former supervene on the latter. Is it a logical truth that a difference in F-properties requires a difference in G-properties? Is this covariance due to the causal laws that actually obtain? Is it a matter of metaphysical necessity? Asking these questions about the way in which F-properties supervene may help us decide whether the dependence is, for example, a wholly analytic affair, a type of causal dependence, a matter of constitution, or a matter of genuine identity.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of CBR has been very profitable for many areas of artificial intelligence. Applying CBR to automated deduction, however, is a very intricate problem. The premise ???small changes of a problem cause small changes of its solution??? is definitely not satisfied by automated deduction. Therefore, case adaptation by means of symbolic proof transformation techniques is very limited.

In view of the fact that automated deduction essentially is a search problem, we propose to utilize case adaptation for selecting and configuring a search-guiding heuristic based on known cases. This also allows us to elegantly integrate methods for learning search-guiding heuristics which can significantly improve performance. The evaluation step of CBR corresponds to an attempt of the theorem prover at hand to solve a problem employing the heuristic provided by case adaptation. Experimental studies demonstrated that this approach is viable and actually produces promising results.},

goals while radically improving its general intelligence. As a meta-
architecture, GOLEM can be wrapped around a variety of different
base-level AGI systems, and also has a role for a powerful narrow-AI
subcomponent as a probability estimator. The motivation underlying
these ideas is the desire to create AGI systems fullling the multiple
criteria of being: massively and self-improvingly intelligent; probably
benecial; and almost surely not destructive.},

  Abstract                 = {The transition from slow to rapid word-learning was examined in a longitudinal study of 18 children. Beginning at age 1;2, mothers kept a diary of children's words. Diary entries were discussed during phone calls to the home every 2?? weeks. A chronological record of nouns and other word classes was coded from the diary records.

Thirteen children evidenced a prolonged period of up to three months during which rate of acquisition markedly increased. Almost threequarters of the words learned during this period were nouns. Five children evidenced more gradual word-learning, and acquired a balance of nouns and other word classes. These results suggest that the terms ???vocabulary spurt??? and ???naming explosion??? best describe children who focus their early linguistic efforts on a single strategy: learning names for things. Other children may attempt to encode a broad range of experience with a more varied lexicon, a strategy that results in more gradual lexical growth.},

that can accept fac ts
, retrieve items from

logical deductions necessary to answer 
questions.
Two versions of such a system have beem implemented
, and the authors
expect these to be the first in an evolving 
series of question
answerers.
The first system
, QA1
, is based upon relational informa 
tion
organized in a list-
structured memory. 
The data consist of general
facts about relations as well as specific 
facts about objects. 
QAl
has limited deductive 
ability.
QA2 is based upon 
formal theorem-
proving techniques. 
Facts are
represented by statements in the predicate 
calculus. Al 
though the
memory organization 
is simpler than that of QA1
, the sophisticated
logical abili ties of 
QA2 result in greater question-
answering power.
The report gives examples of the performance of QAl and QA2 on
typical problems that have been done by previous question-answerers
and describes plans for extending the capabili 
ties of QA2.},

  Title                    = {Desire-Satisfaction Theories of Welfare},
  Author                   = {Christopher Heathwood},
  School                   = {Graduate School of the University of Massachusetts Amherst},

  Abstract                 = {Theories of welfare (or well-being or ???the good life???) answer the ancient 
question, What makes a person???s life go well? Prominent among these are desire-
satisfaction or preferentist theories, according to which welfare has to do ultimately 
with desire. This dissertation aims (i) to criticize some recent popular arguments 
against standard desire-satisfaction theories of welfare, (ii) to develop and defend a 
novel version of the desire-satisfaction theory capable of answering the better 
objections, (iii) to defend the thesis that pleasure is reducible to desire, and (iv) to 
demonstrate an interesting link between preferentism and hedonism. 
The second chapter (the first is the introduction) defends a simple ???actualist??? 
desire-satisfaction theory against the contention that such a theory cannot accommodate 
the fact that we can desire things that are bad for us. All the allegedly defective desires, 
I attempt to show, are either not genuinely defective or else can be accounted for by the 
theory. 
The third chapter criticizes the popular line that standard desire-based theories 
of welfare are incompatible with the conceptual possibility of self-sacrifice. I show that 
even the simplest imaginable, completely unrestricted desire theory is compatible with 
self-sacrifice, so long as it is formulated properly. 
The fourth chapter presents and defends a theory according to which welfare 
consists in the perceived satisfaction, or ???subjective satisfaction,??? of desire. I argue that 
this theory is best suited to deflect the many lines of argument threatening the 
preferentist program. 
The fifth chapter defends the view that desire is what unifies the heterogeneous 
lot of experiences that all count as sensory pleasures. I develop and defend a desire 
theory of sensory pleasure. 
The sixth chapter argues that the most plausible form of preferentism is 
equivalent to the most plausible form of its main rival, hedonism. This is because what 
the best preferentism says ??? that welfare consists in subjective desire satisfaction ??? is 
the same as what the best hedonism says ??? that welfare consists in propositional 
pleasure ??? given a reduction of pleasure to desire along the lines of that defended above.},

  Abstract                 = {Orseau and Ring, as well as Dewey, have recently described problems, including self-delusion, 
with the behavior of agents using various definitions of utility functions. An agent's utility 
function is defined in terms of the agent's history of interactions with its environment. This paper 
argues, via two examples, that the behavior problems can be avoided by formulating the utility 
function in two steps: 1) inferring a model of the environment from interactions, and 2) computing 
utility as a function of the environment model. Basing a utility function on a model that the agent 
must learn implies that the utility function must initially be expressed in terms of specifications to 
be matched to structures in the learned model. 
These specifications constitute prior assumptions 
about the environment so this approach will not work with arbitrary environments. But the 
approach should work fo
r agents designed by humans to act in 
the physical world. The paper also 
addresses the issue of self-modifying agents and 
shows that if provided with the possibility to 
modify their utility functions agents will not choose to do so, under some usual assumptions.},

The only way one strategy can outperform another is if it is specialized to the structure of the specific problem under consideration. Since optimization is a central human activity, an appreciation of the NFLT and its consequences is essential. In this paper, we present a framework for conceptualizing optimization that leads to a simple but rigorous explanation of the NFLT and its implications.},

However, economic theories posit that decision-makers behave as though different options have different subjective values. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that neural activity in several brain regions???particularly the ventral striatum, medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex???tracks the revealed subjective value of delayed monetary rewards. This similarity provides unambiguous evidence that the subjective value of potential rewards is explicitly represented in the human brain.},

  Abstract                 = {The AM program, an early attempt to mechanize learning by discovery . has recently been expande d
and extended to several other task domains. ,amt's ultimate failure apparently was due to its inability t o
discover new, powerful. domain-specific heuristics for the various new fields it uncovered . At tha t
time, it seemed straight-forward to simply add 'Heuristics' as one more field in which to let AM
explore, observe, define, and develop . That task???learning new heuristics by discovery???turned out to
be much more difficult than was realized initially, and we have just now achieved some successes a t
it. Along the way, it became clearer why Am had succeeded in the first place . and why it was so
difficult to use the same paradigm to discover new heuristics . In essence. AM was an automatic
programming system . whose primitive actions were modifications to pieces of LISP code, code whic h
represented the characteristic functions of various math concepts . It was only because of the dee p
relationship between LISP and Mathematics that these operations (loop unwinding, recursion elimina-
tion, composition, argument elimination, function substitution, etc .) which were basic LISP mutators
also turned out to yield a high 'hit rate' of viable, useful new math concepts when applied to
previously-known, useful math concepts . But no such deep relationship existed between LISP an d
Heuristics, and when the basic automatic programming operators were applied to viable, usefu l
heuristics, they almost always produced useless (often worse than useless) new rules . Our work on th e
nature of heuristics has enabled the construction of a new language in which the statement of heuristic s
is more natural and compact . Briefly, the vocabulary includes many types of conditions, actions, an d
descriptive properties that a heuristic might possess ; instead of writing a large lump of LISP code to
represent the heuristic, one spreads the same information out across dozens of 'slots' . By employing
this new language. the old property that AM satisfied fortuitously is once again satisfied : the primitiv e
syntactic operators usually now produce meaningful semantic variants of what they operate on . Th e
ties to the foundations of Heuretics have been engineered into the syntax and vocabulary of the ne w
language, partly by design and partly by evolution, much as John McCarthy engineered ties to th e
foundations of Mathematics into LISP . The EURISKO program embodies this language, and it is
described in this paper. along with its results in eight task domains : design of naval fleets, elementary
set theory and number theory . LISP programming, biological evolution, games in general, the design of
three-dimensional VLSI devices, the discovery of heuristics which help the system discover heuristics ,
and the discovery of appropriate new types of 'slots' in each domain . Along the way, some very
powerful new concepts, designs, and heuristics were indeed discovered mechanically . Characteristics
that make a domain ripe for AM-like exploration for new concepts and conjectures are explicated, plu s
features that make a domain especially suitable for EURISKO-level exploration for new heuristics .},

Tableau method based on logic reinforcement learning is provided according to the real problem of tableau automated theorem proving method that need to extend for different logic formulae and it will influence the automated theorem proving efficiency. This method takes the combination of logic formulae and expansion result as abstract state, expansion rules as actions, node closes as the aim and receives a reward. On the one hand the method is suitable for a lot of types of tableau automated theorem proving and the blindness of reasoning is reduced. On the other hand simple automated theorem proving result can be used in complicated automated theorem proving and efficiency is raised.},

  Abstract                 = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account1, deeply rooted in psychological2 and neuroscientific3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems4, 5, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms3. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains6, 7, 8, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks9, 10, 11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games12. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {Many researchers have argued that a self-improving artificial intelligence (AI) could be-
come so vastly more powerful than humans that we would not be able to stop it from
achieving its goals. If so, and if the AI???s goals differ from ours, then this could be dis-
astrous for humans. One proposed solution is to program the AI???s goal system to want
what we want before the AI self-improves beyond our capacity to control it. Unfortunately, it is difficult to specify what we want. After clarifying what we mean by ???intel-
ligence,??? we offer a series of ???intuition pumps??? from the field of moral philosophy for
our conclusion that human values are complex and difficult to specify. We then survey
the evidence from the psychology of motivation, moral psychology, and neuroeconomics
that supports our position. We conclude by recommending ideal preference theories of
value as a promising approach for developing a machine ethics suitable for navigating
an intelligence explosion or ???technological singularity.???},

Beginning with a base compound, we consider the problem of searching for a chemical derivative of the molecule that best treats a given disease. The problem of choosing molecules to test to maximize the expected quality of the best compound discovered may be formulated mathematically as a ranking-and-selection problem in which each molecule is an alternative. We apply a recently developed algorithm, known as the knowledge-gradient algorithm, that uses correlations in our Bayesian prior distribution between the performance of different alternatives (molecules) to dramatically reduce the number of molecular tests required, but it has heavy computational requirements that limit the number of possible alternatives to a few thousand. We develop computational improvements that allow the knowledge-gradient method to consider much larger sets of alternatives, and we demonstrate the method on a problem with 87,120 alternatives.},

  Abstract                 = {When modeling a decision problem using the influence diagram framework, the quantitative part rests on two principal components: probabilities for representing the decision maker's uncertainty about the domain and utilities for representing preferences. Over the last decade, several methods have been developed for learning the probabilities from a database. However, methods for learning the utilities have only received limited attention in the computer science community. A promising approach for learning a decision maker's utility function is to take outset in the decision maker's observed behavioral patterns, and then find a utility function which (together with a domain model) can explain this behavior. That is, it is assumed that decision maker's preferences are reflected in the behavior. Standard learning algorithms also assume that the decision maker is behavioral consistent, i.e., given a model of the decision problem, there exists a utility function which can account for all the observed behavior. Unfortunately, this assumption is rarely valid in real-world decision problems, and in these situations existing learning methods may only identify a trivial utility function. In this paper we relax this consistency assumption, and propose two algorithms for learning a decision maker's utility function from possibly inconsistent behavior; inconsistent behavior is interpreted as random deviations from an underlying (true) utility function. The main difference between the two algorithms is that the first facilitates a form of batch learning whereas the second focuses on adaptation and is particularly well-suited for scenarios where the DM's preferences change over time. Empirical results demonstrate the tractability of the algorithms, and they also show that the algorithms converge toward the true utility function for even very small sets of observations.},

  Abstract                 = {Most automated reasoning systems rely on human knowledge or heuristics to guide the reasoning or search for proofs. We have evaluated the use of a powerful general search algorithm to search in the space of mathematical proofs. In our approach, automated reasoning is seen as an instance of automated programming where the proof is seen as a program (of functions corresponding to rules of inference) which transforms a statement into an axiom. We use genetic programming as the general technique for automated programming. We show that such a system can be used to evolve mathematical proofs in complex domains, i.e. arithmetics. We extend our previous research by the implementation of an efficient and stable C-language system in contrast to earlier work in Prolog.},

  Abstract                 = {Optimization is one of the most general problems in computer science and mathematics.
In its most general form, the problem consists in finding an input x to some mathematical objective function f such that the corresponding output f (x) is as big as possible.
Throughout my thesis I also assume the function to be treated as a blackbox and that
optimization is done by an iterative process of trial and error. The problem of optimization
has received wide attention and a lot of algorithms can be found in the literature. Although
the no-free-lunch theorems show that optimization algorithms can only work well under
certain, usually probabilistic, assumptions, general optimization algorithms usually don???t
make these assumptions explicitly nor are they parametrized by them. Overall, they tend
to be proved in practice rather than being based on solid theoretical foundations. In my
thesis I develop an optimization algorithm, which is parametrized by a prior probability
distribution over objective functions and can be shown to always choose the best trials
in a Bayesian sense. I analyze the algorithm???s time and space complexity to show that
while it is not applicable to the vast majority of real-world optimization problems, it can
be used for small dummy problem classes to benchmark other, e.g. heuristic, optimization
algorithms. I then go on to compare the performances of the Bayes-optimal with a Bayesian
optimization algorithm called expected improvement maximization as well as a simple
hill climbing heuristic on various problem classes. Such comparisons are hoped to reveal
insights into why and when heuristics work, both in optimization and artificial intelligence
in general.},

The last few decades though have seen the occurrence of a ???Bayesian revolution,??? and Bayesian probability theory is now commonly em- ployed (oftentimes with stunning success) in many scientific disciplines, from astrophysics to neuroscience. It is most often used to judge the relative validity of hypotheses in the face of noisy, sparse, or uncertain data, or to adjust the parameters of a specific model. Here we discuss the basics of Bayesian proba- bility theory and show how it has been utilized in models of cortical processing and neural decoding.},

  Abstract                 = {In order for an agent to perform well in partially observable domains, it is usually necessary for actions to depend on the history
of observations. In this paper, we explore
a \textit{stigmergic} approach, in which the agent???s
actions include the ability to set and clear
bits in an external memory, and the external memory is included as part of the input
to the agent. In this case, we need to learn a
reactive policy in a highly non-Markovian domain. We explore two algorithms:
SARSA(??),
which has had empirical success in partially
observable domains, and VAPS, a new algorithm due to Baird and Moore, with conver-
gence guarantees in partially observable domains. We compare the performance of these
two algorithms on benchmark problems.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers the consequences of endowing an intel-
ligent agent with the ability to modify its own code. The intelligent agent
is patterned closely after AIXI with these specific assumptions: 1) The
agent is allowed to arbitrarily modify its own inputs if it so chooses;
2) The agent???s code is a part of the environment and may be read and
written by the environment. The first of these we call the ???delusion box???;
the second we call ???mortality???. Within this framework, we discuss and
compare four very different kinds of agents, specifically: reinforcement-
learning, goal-seeking, prediction-seeking, and knowledge-seeking agents.
Our main results are that: 1) The reinforcement-learning agent under
reasonable circumstances behaves exactly like an agent whose sole task
is to survive (to preserve the integrity of its code); and 2) Only the
knowledge-seeking agent behaves completely as expected.},

  Abstract                 = {The subjective well-being or happiness of individuals is an important metric for societies. Although happiness is influenced by life circumstances and population demographics such as wealth, we know little about how the cumulative influence of daily life events are aggregated into subjective feelings. Using computational modeling, we show that emotional reactivity in the form of momentary happiness in response to outcomes of a probabilistic reward task is explained not by current task earnings, but by the combined influence of recent reward expectations and prediction errors arising from those expectations. The robustness of this account was evident in a large-scale replication involving 18,420 participants. Using functional MRI, we show that the very same influences account for task-dependent striatal activity in a manner akin to the influences underpinning changes in happiness.},

  Abstract                 = {??????All life is problem solving,?????? said Popper. To
deal with arbitrary problems in arbitrary environments, an
ultimate cognitive agent should use its limited hardware in
the ??????best?????? and ??????most efficient?????? possible way. Can we
formally nail down this informal statement, and derive a
mathematically rigorous blueprint of ultimate cognition?
Yes, we can, using Kurt G??del???s celebrated self-reference
trick of 1931 in a new way. G??del exhibited the limits of
mathematics and computation by creating a formula that
speaks about itself, claiming to be unprovable by an
algorithmic theorem prover: either the formula is true but
unprovable, or math itself is flawed in an algorithmic sense.
Here we describe an agent-controlling program that speaks
about itself, ready to rewrite itself in arbitrary fashion once
it has found a proof that the rewrite is
useful according to a user-defined utility function. Any such a rewrite is necessarily globally optimal???no local maxima!???since this
proof necessarily must have demonstrated the uselessness
of continuing the proof search for even better rewrites. Our
self-referential program will optimally speed up its proof
searcher and other program parts, but only if the speed up???s
utility is indeed provable???even ultimate cognition has
limits of the G??delian kind.},

  Abstract                 = {A Goedel machine solves general computational problems in a possibly stochastic and reactive environment. Its initial software includes an axiomatic description of (1) the Goedel machine's hardware, (2) known aspects of the environment, (3) goals and rewards to be achieved, (4) costs of actions and computations, (5) the initial software itself (no circularity involved here). It also includes a possibly sub-optimal initial problem-solving policy and a proof searcher searching the space of computable proof techniques - that is, programs whose outputs are proofs. Unlike previous approaches, the self-referential Goedel machine will rewrite any part of its software (including axioms and proof searcher) as soon as it has found a proof that this will improve its future performance. By definition, it produces optimal self-improvements, given arbitrary formalized problems and typically limited computational resources; its optimality notion is not restricted to the concept of asymptotic optimality. To initialize the proof searcher we may use the recent Optimal Ordered Problem Solver.},

  Abstract                 = {The traditional theory of Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic probability focuses on monotone Turing machines with one-way write-only output tape. This naturally leads to the universal enumerable Solomonoff-Levin measure. Here we introduce more general, nonenumerable but cumulatively enumerable measures (CEMs) derived from Turing machines with lexicographically nondecreasing output and random input, and even more general approximable measures and distributions computable in the limit. We obtain a natural hierarchy of generalizations of algorithmic probability and Kolmogorov complexity, suggesting that the "true" information content of some (possibly infinite) bitstring x is the size of the shortest nonhalting program that converges to x and nothing but x on a Turing machine that can edit its previous outputs. Among other things we show that there are objects computable in the limit yet more random than Chaitin's "number of wisdom" Omega, that any approximable measure of x is small for any x lacking a short description, that there is no universal approximable distribution, that there is a universal CEM, and that any nonenumerable CEM of x is small for any x lacking a short enumerating program. We briefly mention consequences for universes sampled from such priors.},

A connectionist network is used to learn heuristics which order the choices at nondeterministic branch-points. This is done by estimating their relative chance for leading to a shortest proof. Using the method it was possible to reduce the search effort required by a high speed theorem prover. Several experiments are presented showing the attained improvements.},

systems become increasingly intelligent and autonomous, what design principles
can best ensure that their behavior is aligned with the interests of the operators?
We focus on two major technical obstacles to AI alignment: the challenge of
specifying the right kind of objective functions, and the challenge of designing
AI systems that avoid unintended consequences and undesirable behavior
even in cases where the objective function does not line up perfectly with the
intentions of the designers.
Open problems surveyed in this research proposal include: How can we train
reinforcement learners to take actions that are more amenable to meaningful
assessment by intelligent overseers? What kinds of objective functions incen-
tivize a system to \not have an overly large impact" or \not have many side
e ects"? We discuss these questions, related work, and potential directions
for future research, with the goal of highlighting relevant research topics in
machine learning that appear tractable today.},

I argue that with a sufficiently broad definition of mathematics, it implies the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH) that our physical world is an abstract mathematical structure. I discuss various implications of the ERH and MUH, ranging from standard physics topics like symmetries, irreducible representations, units, free parameters, randomness and initial conditions to broader issues like consciousness, parallel universes and G??del incompleteness. I hypothesize that only computable and decidable (in G??del???s sense) structures exist, which alleviates the cosmological measure problem and may help explain why our physical laws appear so simple. I also comment on the intimate relation between mathematical structures, computations, simulations and physical systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Artificial intelligence (AI) will transform the world later this century. I expect this transition will be a ???soft takeoff??? in which many sectors of society update together in response to incremental AI developments, though the possibility of a harder takeoff in which a single AI project ???goes foom??? shouldn???t be ruled out. If a rogue AI gained control of Earth, it would proceed to accomplish its goals by colonizing the galaxy and undertaking some very interesting achievements in science and engineering. On the other hand, it would not necessarily respect human values, including the value of preventing the suffering of less powerful creatures. Whether a rogue-AI scenario would entail more expected suffering than other scenarios is a question to explore further. Regardless, the field of AI ethics and policy seems to be a very important space where altruists can make a positive-sum impact along many dimensions. Expanding dialogue and challenging us-vs.-them prejudices could be valuable.},

  Abstract                 = {Organisms of various kinds can fake their reward signals, or "wirehead." This is true both for simple reinforcement learners that optimize raw input stimuli as well as more sophisticated agents that optimize goals defined relative to beliefs about the external world. Evolution optimizes agents to avoid faking input signals, but it also seems that agents may naturally avoid wireheading in many cases, because either they're too dumb to know how to do it, or they're smart enough to realize that wireheading would decrease their goal satisfaction relative to their current beliefs and values. This argument is speculative and may be proven wrong empirically as people try building AIs with various utility functions. (Note: I personally prefer for people to move slower rather than faster on building AI.) Even if AIs don't literally wirehead in the sense of fooling themselves into believing happy thoughts, the task of precisely specifying the content for their goals remains extremely difficult.},

  Abstract                 = {The relationship between the Bayesian approach and the minimum description length approach is established. We sharpen and clarify the general modeling principles minimum description length (MDL) and minimum message length (MML), abstracted as the ideal MDL principle and defined from Bayes's rule by means of Kolmogorov complexity. The basic condition under which the ideal principle should be applied is encapsulated as the fundamental inequality, which in broad terms states that the principle is valid when the data are random, relative to every contemplated hypothesis and also these hypotheses are random relative to the (universal) prior. The ideal principle states that the prior probability associated with the hypothesis should be given by the algorithmic universal probability, and the sum of the log universal probability of the model plus the log of the probability of the data given the model should be minimized. If we restrict the model class to finite sets then application of the ideal principle turns into Kolmogorov's minimal sufficient statistic. In general, we show that data compression is almost always the best strategy, both in model selection and prediction},

  Abstract                 = {This is the first of two papers that use off-training set (OTS) error to investigate the assumption-free relationship between learning algorithms. This first paper discusses the senses in which there are no a priori distinctions between learning algorithms. (The second paper discusses the senses in which there are such distinctions.) In this first paper it is shown, loosely speaking, that for any two algorithms A and B, there are ???as many??? targets (or priors over targets) for which A has lower expected OTS error than B as vice versa, for loss functions like zero-one loss. In particular, this is true if A is cross-validation and B is ???anti-cross-validation??? (choose the learning algorithm with largest cross-validation error). This paper ends with a discussion of the implications of these results for computational learning theory. It is shown that one cannot say: if empirical misclassification rate is low, the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of your generalizer is small, and the training set is large, then with high probability your OTS error is small. Other implications for ???membership queries??? algorithms and ???punting??? algorithms are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper argues that we should replace the common classification of
theories of welfare into the categories of hedonism, desire theories, and objective
list theories. The tripartite classification is objectionable because it is unduly narrow
and it is confusing: it excludes theories of welfare that are worthy of discussion, and
it obscures important distinctions. In its place, the paper proposes two independent
classifications corresponding to a distinction emphasised by Roger Crisp: a four-
category classification of enumerative theories (about which items constitute wel-
fare), and a four-category classification of explanatory theories (about why these
items constitute welfare).},

  Abstract                 = {Disputes between evidential decision theory and causal decision theory have continued
for decades, and many theorists state dissatisfaction with both alternatives. Timeless
decision theory (TDT) is an extension of causal decision networks that compactly repre-
sents uncertainty about correlated computational processes and represents the decision-
maker as such a process. This simple extension enables TDT to return the one-box
answer for Newcomb???s Problem, the causal answer in Solomon???s Problem, and mutual
cooperation in the one-shot Prisoner???s Dilemma, for reasons similar to human intuition.
Furthermore, an evidential or causal decision-maker will choose to imitate a timeless
decision-maker on a large class of problems if given the option to do so.},
