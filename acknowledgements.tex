I came up with superrational compromise after a conversation with Lukas
Gloor about decision theory and the multiverse. Prior to writing this
paper, I extensively discussed the topic with him, Carl Shulman, and
Brian Tomasik. I also thank Max Daniel, Tobias Baumann, Carl Shulman,
David Althaus, Lukas Gloor, Kaj Sotala, Jonas Vollmer, Johannes
Treutlein, Lucius Caviola, Joshua Fox, Jens Jaeger, Ruair√≠ Donnelly,
Brian Tomasik, Owen Cotton-Barratt, Magnus Vinding and Dominik Peters for
valuable discussions and comments on this paper. Last but not least, I
am indebted to Adrian Rorheim for careful copy editing and Alfredo Parra for typesetting.
