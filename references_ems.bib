  title     = "The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",
  author    = "Hanson, Robin",
  abstract  = "Robots may one day rule the world, but what is a robot-ruled
               Earth like? Many think the first truly smart robots will be
               brain emulations or ems. Scan a human brain, then run a model
               with the same connections on a fast computer, and you have a
               robot brain, but recognizably human. Train an em to do some job
               and copy it a million times: an army of workers is at your
               disposal. When they can be made cheaply, within perhaps a
               century, ems will displace humans in most jobs. In this new
               economic era, the world economy may double in size every few
               weeks. Some say we can't know the future, especially following
               such a disruptive new technology, but Professor Robin Hanson
               sets out to prove them wrong. Applying decades of expertise in
               physics, computer science, and economics, he uses standard
               theories to paint a detailed picture of a world dominated by
               ems. While human lives don't change greatly in the em era, em
               lives are as different from ours as our lives are from those of
               our farmer and forager ancestors. Ems make us question common
               assumptions of moral progress, because they reject many of the
               values we hold dear. Read about em mind speeds, body sizes, job
               training and career paths, energy use and cooling
               infrastructure, virtual reality, aging and retirement, death and
               immortality, security, wealth inequality, religion,
               teleportation, identity, cities, politics, law, war, status,
               friendship and love. This book shows you just how strange your
               descendants may be, though ems are no stranger than we would
               appear to our ancestors. To most ems, it seems good to be an em.",

  abstract    = "The parental caregiving motivational system leads people to
                 behave selflessly. However, given that the purpose of this
                 motivation is the protection of close kin, it might also lead
                 to aggression toward distant, threatening others. In the
                 present studies, we wished to investigate the effects of
                 behaviorally activating the caregiving motivational system on
                 out-group bias. On the basis of previous work in behavioral
                 ecology, we predicted that activation of the caregiving system
                 would enhance bias against out-groups whenever their members
                 posed a salient threat. This prediction was confirmed in three
                 studies (total N = 866) across different populations,
                 manipulations, and measures. We discuss the possible
                 importance of continued research into the behavioral

  abstract  = "Games are everywhere: Drivers manoeuvring in heavy traffic are
               playing a driving game. Bargain hunters bidding on eBay are
               playing an auctioning game. A firm negotiating next year's wage
               is playing a bargaining game. The opposing candidates in an
               election are playing a political game. The supermarket's price
               for corn flakes is decided by playing an economic game. Game
               theory is about how to play such games in a rational way. Even
               when the players have not thought everything out in advance,
               game theory often works for the same reason that mindless
               animals sometimes end up behaving very cleverly: evolutionary
               forces eliminate irrational play because it is unfit. Game
               theory has seen spectacular successes in evolutionary biology
               and economics, and is beginning to revolutionize other
               disciplines from psychology to political science. This Very
               Short Introduction introduces the fascinating world of game
               theory, showing how it can be understood without mathematical
               equations, and revealing that everything from how to play poker
               optimally to the sex ratio among bees can be understood by
               anyone willing to think seriously about the problem. ABOUT THE
