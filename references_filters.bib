  abstract  = "The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other
               animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our
               species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger
               muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains. If
               machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general
               intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very
               powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us
               humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our
               species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine
               superintelligence. But we have one advantage: we get to make the
               first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or
               otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an
               intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a
               controlled detonation? To get closer to an answer to this
               question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape
               of topics and considerations. Read the book and learn about
               oracles, genies, singletons; about boxing methods, tripwires,
               and mind crime; about humanity's cosmic endowment and
               differential technological development; indirect normativity,
               instrumental convergence, whole brain emulation and technology
               couplings; Malthusian economics and dystopian evolution;
               artificial intelligence, and biological cognitive enhancement,
               and collective intelligence. This profoundly ambitious and
               original book picks its way carefully through a vast tract of
               forbiddingly difficult intellectual terrain. Yet the writing is
               so lucid that it somehow makes it all seem easy. After an
               utterly engrossing journey that takes us to the frontiers of
               thinking about the human condition and the future of intelligent
               life, we find in Nick Bostrom's work nothing less than a
               reconceptualization of the essential task of our time.",

               {EVERYBODY?}: {Seventy-Five} Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and
               the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life",
  author    = "Webb, Stephen",
  abstract  = "Given the fact that there are perhaps 400 billion stars in our
               Galaxy alone, and perhaps 400 billion galaxies in the Universe,
               it stands to reason that somewhere out there, in the
               14-billion-year-old cosmos, there is or once was a civilization
               at least as advanced as our own. The sheer enormity of the
               numbers almost demands that we accept the truth of this
               hypothesis. Why, then, have we encountered no evidence, no
               messages, no artifacts of these extraterrestrials? In this
               second, significantly revised and expanded edition of his widely
               popular book, Webb discusses in detail the (for now!) 75 most
               cogent and intriguing solutions to Fermi's famous paradox: If
               the numbers strongly point to the existence of extraterrestrial
               civilizations, why have we found no evidence of them?Reviews
               from the first edition:``Amidst the plethora of books that treat
               the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence, this one by
               Webb ... is outstanding. ... Each solution is presented in a
               very logical, interesting, thorough manner with accompanying
               explanations and notes that the intelligent layperson can
               understand. Webb digs into the issues ... by considering a very
               broad set of in-depth solutions that he addresses through an
               interesting and challenging mode of presentation that stretches
               the mind. ... An excellent book for anyone who has ever asked
               ‘Are we alone?’.'' (W. E. Howard III, Choice, March,
               2003)``Fifty ideas are presented ... that reveal a clearly
               reasoned examination of what is known as ‘The Fermi Paradox’.
               ... For anyone who enjoys a good detective story, or using their
               thinking faculties and stretching the imagination to the limits
               ... ‘Where is everybody’ will be enormously informative and
               entertaining. ... Read this book, and whatever your views are
               about life elsewhere in the Universe, your appreciation for how
               special life is here on Earth will be enhanced! A worthy
               addition to any personal library.'' (Philip Bridle, BBC Radio,
               March, 2003)Since gaining a BSc in physics from the University
               of Bristol and a PhD in theoretical physics from the University
               of Manchester, Stephen Webb has worked in a variety of
               universities in the UK. He is a regular contributor to the
               Yearbook of Astronomy series and has published an undergraduate
               textbook on distance determination in astronomy and cosmology as
               well as several popular science books. His interest in the Fermi
               paradox combines lifelong interests in both science and science

  title     = "The Age of Em: Work, Love, and Life when Robots Rule the Earth",
  author    = "Hanson, Robin",
  abstract  = "Robots may one day rule the world, but what is a robot-ruled
               Earth like? Many think the first truly smart robots will be
               brain emulations or ems. Scan a human brain, then run a model
               with the same connections on a fast computer, and you have a
               robot brain, but recognizably human. Train an em to do some job
               and copy it a million times: an army of workers is at your
               disposal. When they can be made cheaply, within perhaps a
               century, ems will displace humans in most jobs. In this new
               economic era, the world economy may double in size every few
               weeks. Some say we can't know the future, especially following
               such a disruptive new technology, but Professor Robin Hanson
               sets out to prove them wrong. Applying decades of expertise in
               physics, computer science, and economics, he uses standard
               theories to paint a detailed picture of a world dominated by
               ems. While human lives don't change greatly in the em era, em
               lives are as different from ours as our lives are from those of
               our farmer and forager ancestors. Ems make us question common
               assumptions of moral progress, because they reject many of the
               values we hold dear. Read about em mind speeds, body sizes, job
               training and career paths, energy use and cooling
               infrastructure, virtual reality, aging and retirement, death and
               immortality, security, wealth inequality, religion,
               teleportation, identity, cities, politics, law, war, status,
               friendship and love. This book shows you just how strange your
               descendants may be, though ems are no stranger than we would
               appear to our ancestors. To most ems, it seems good to be an em.",
