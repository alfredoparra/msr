               evaluation, and, as a result, draw undue support for their

               the result of exposing contending factions in a social dispute
               to an identical body of relevant empirical evidence may be not a
               narrowing of disagreement but rather an increase in
               polarization. To test these assumptions, 48 undergraduates
               supporting and opposing capital punishment were exposed to 2
               purported studies, one seemingly confirming and one seemingly
               disconfirming their existing beliefs about the deterrent

               a select group of others (Us), and for fighting off everyone
               else (Them). But modern life has thrust the world's tribes into
               a shared space, creating conflicts of interest and clashes of
               values, along with unprecedented opportunities. As the world
               shrinks, the moral lines that divide us become more salient and
               more puzzling. We fight over everything from tax codes to gay
               marriage to global warming, and we wonder where, if at all, we
               can find our common ground.A grand synthesis of neuroscience,
               psychology, and philosophy, Moral Tribes reveals the underlying
               causes of modern conflict and lights a way forward. Our emotions
               make us social animals, turning Me into Us. But they also make
               us tribal animals, turning Us against Them. Our tribal emotions
               make us fight, sometimes with bombs, sometimes with words, and
               often with life-and-death stakes. Drawing inspiration from moral
               philosophy and cutting-edge science, Moral Tribes shows when we
               should trust our instincts, when we should reason, and how the
               right kind of reasoning can move us forward.Joshua Greene is the
               director of Harvard University's Moral Cognition Lab, a
               pioneering scientist, a philosopher, and an acclaimed teacher.
               The great challenge of Moral Tribes is this: How can we get
               along with Them when what they want feels so wrong? Finally,
               Greene offers a surprisingly simple set of maxims for navigating
               the modern moral terrain, a practical road map for solving
               problems and living better lives.",

                   this article, which otherwise appears as originally
                   published in 1990, except for the updating of references.
                   The original abstract follows. This is a critical review of
                   the literature on many-worlds interpretations (MWI), with
                   arguments drawn partly from earlier critiques by Bell and
                   Stein. The essential postulates involved in various MWI are
                   extracted, and their consistency with the evident physical
                   world is examined. Arguments are presented against MWI
                   proposed by Everett, Graham and DeWitt. The relevance of
                   frequency operators to MWI is examined; it is argued that
                   frequency operator theorems of Hartle and
                   Farhi-Goldstone-Gutmann do not in themselves provide a
                   probability interpretation for quantum mechanics, and thus
                   neither support existing MWI nor would be useful in
                   constructing new MWI. Comments are made on papers by Geroch
                   and Deutsch that advocate MWI. It is concluded that no

               survive on our own in the wild, often failing to overcome even
               basic challenges, like obtaining food, building shelters, or
               avoiding predators. On the other hand, human groups have
               produced ingenious technologies, sophisticated languages, and
               complex institutions that have permitted us to successfully
               expand into a vast range of diverse environments. What has
               enabled us to dominate the globe, more than any other species,
               while remaining virtually helpless as lone individuals? This
               book shows that the secret of our success lies not in our innate
               intelligence, but in our collective brains---on the ability of
               human groups to socially interconnect and learn from one another
               over generations. Drawing insights from lost European explorers,
               clever chimpanzees, mobile hunter-gatherers, neuroscientific
               findings, ancient bones, and the human genome, Joseph Henrich
               demonstrates how our collective brains have propelled our
               species' genetic evolution and shaped our biology. Our early
               capacities for learning from others produced many cultural
               innovations, such as fire, cooking, water containers, plant
               knowledge, and projectile weapons, which in turn drove the
               expansion of our brains and altered our physiology, anatomy, and
               psychology in crucial ways. Later on, some collective brains
               generated and recombined powerful concepts, such as the lever,
               wheel, screw, and writing, while also creating the institutions
               that continue to alter our motivations and perceptions. Henrich
               shows how our genetics and biology are inextricably interwoven
               with cultural evolution, and how culture-gene interactions
               launched our species on an extraordinary evolutionary
               trajectory. Tracking clues from our ancient past to the present,
               The Secret of Our Success explores how the evolution of both our
               cultural and social natures produce a collective intelligence
               that explains both our species' immense success and the origins
               of human uniqueness.",

              Participants were 506 university students in Aotearoa New Zealand
              invited to imagine a society in 2050 where most individuals
              consume a plant-based, vegetarian, or vegan diet. A thematic

                 mechanical and natural domains, occluding why they occur and
                 suggesting that their implications are quite limited. Six
                 studies illustrated that IOEDs occur because people adopt an
                 inappropriately abstract construal style when they assess how
                 well they understand concrete concepts. As this mechanism
                 predicts, participants who naturally adopted concrete
                 construal styles (Study 1) or were induced to adopt a concrete
                 construal style (Studies 2-4 and 6), experienced diminished
                 IOEDs. Two additional studies documented a novel IOED in the
                 social psychological domain of electoral voting (Studies 5 and
                 6), demonstrating the generality of the construal mechanism,
                 the authors also extended the presumed boundary conditions of
                 the effect beyond mechanical and natural domains. These
                 findings suggest a novel factor that might contribute to such
                 diverse social-cognitive shortcomings as stereotyping,
                 egocentrism, and the planning fallacy, where people adopt
                 abstract representations of concepts that should be
                 represented concretely.",

               Persons, one of the landmarks of twentieth-century philosophy.
               In this first volume Parfit presents a powerful new treatment of
               reasons and rationality, and a critical examination of three
               systematic moral theories --- Kant's ethics, contractualism, and
               consequentialism --- leading to his own ground-breaking
               synthetic conclusion. Along the way he discusses a wide range of
               moral issues, such as the significance of consent, treating
               people as a means rather than an end, and free will and
               responsibility. On What Matters is already the most-discussed
               work in moral philosophy: its publication is likely to establish

  abstract  = "In Good and Real, Gary Drescher examines a series of provocative
               paradoxes about consciousness, choice, ethics, quantum
               mechanics, and other topics, in an effort to reconcile a purely
               mechanical view of the universe with key aspects of our
               subjective impressions of our own existence. Many scientists
               suspect that the universe can ultimately be described by a
               simple (perhaps even deterministic) formalism; all that is real
               unfolds mechanically according to that formalism. But how, then,
               is it possible for us to be conscious, or to make genuine
               choices? And how can there be an ethical dimension to such
               choices? Drescher sketches computational models of
               consciousness, choice, and subjunctive reasoning -- what would
               happen if this or that were to occur? -- to show how such
               phenomena are compatible with a mechanical, even deterministic
               universe. Analyses of Newcomb's Problem (a paradox about choice)
               and the Prisoner's Dilemma (a paradox about self-interest vs.
               altruism, arguably reducible to Newcomb's Problem) help bring
               the problems and proposed solutions into focus. Regarding
               quantum mechanics, Drescher builds on Everett's relative-state
               formulation -- but presenting a simplified formalism, accessible
               to laypersons -- to argue that, contrary to some popular
               impressions, quantum mechanics is compatible with an objective,
               deterministic physical reality, and that there is no special
               connection between quantum phenomena and consciousness. In each
               of several disparate but intertwined topics ranging from physics
               to ethics, Drescher argues that a missing technical linchpin can
               make the quest for objectivity seem impossible, until the
               elusive technical fix is at hand.",

                   interpretation of quantum mechanics appears to be gradually
                   changing. A (highly unscientific) poll taken at the 1997
                   UMBC quantum mechanics workshop gave the once all-dominant
                   Copenhagen interpretation less than half of the votes. The
                   Many Worlds interpretation (MWI) scored second, comfortably
                   ahead of the Consistent Histories and Bohm interpretations.
                   It is argued that since all the above-mentioned approaches
                   to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics give identical cookbook
                   prescriptions for how to calculate things in practice,
                   practical-minded experimentalists, who have traditionally
                   adopted the ``shut-up-and-calculate interpretation'',
                   typically show little interest in whether cozy classical
                   concepts are in fact real in some untestable metaphysical
                   sense or merely the way we subjectively perceive a
                   mathematically simpler world where the Schrodinger equation
                   describes everything - and that they are therefore becoming
                   less bothered by a profusion of worlds than by a profusion
                   of words. Common objections to the MWI are discussed. It is
                   argued that when environment-induced decoherence is taken

                   identical to those of the Copenhagen interpretation except
                   for an experiment involving a Byzantine form of ``quantum
                   suicide''. This makes the choice between them purely a
                   matter of taste, roughly equivalent to whether one believes

               understanding our behavioral inconsistencies lies in
               understanding the mind's design. The human mind consists of many
               specialized units designed by the process of evolution by
               natural selection. While these modules sometimes work together
               seamlessly, they don't always, resulting in impossibly
               contradictory beliefs, vacillations between patience and
               impulsiveness, violations of our supposed moral principles, and
               overinflated views of ourselves. This modular, evolutionary
               psychological view of the mind undermines deeply held intuitions
               about ourselves, as well as a range of scientific theories that
               require a ``self'' with consistent beliefs and preferences.
               Modularity suggests that there is no ``I.'' Instead, each of us
               is a contentious ``we''--a collection of discrete but
               interacting systems whose constant conflicts shape our
               interactions with one another and our experience of the world.
               In clear language, full of wit and rich in examples, Kurzban
               explains the roots and implications of our inconsistent minds,

  abstract  = "Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this
               book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of
               causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous
               concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications
               in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics,
               philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social
               sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic,
               manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to
               causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the
               relationships between causal connections and statistical
               associations. The book will open the way for including causal
               analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial
               intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and
               economics. Students in these fields will find natural models,
               simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical
               definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have
               evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of
               Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that
               causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer
               science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000
               scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists
               from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this
               revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers
               readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent
               advances in this field of research. Causality will be of
               interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of
               fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships
               from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess
               explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal
               understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating

               Newcomb's Problem",
  author    = "Campbell, Richmond and Sowden, Lanning",
  abstract  = "The Prisoner's Dilemma is a famous problem in game theory. In
               its simplest form, two players are faced with independent
               choices: to cooperate or not to cooperate. Each does better if
               both cooperate than if neither does; but each does better if he
               does not cooperate whatever the other does. The outcome of their
               choice can be the difference between life and death.
               Philosophers see this problem as an abstact model of the classic
               conflict between self-interest and a socially advantageous moral
               order. Some philosophers have argued that it is a special case
               of Newcomb's Problem, technically a puzzle in mathematical
               decision theory. There is a deep division amongst philosophers
               over the nature and extent of the relationship between these two
               dilemmas. Both, however, threaten the foundations of ethical and
               political theory, even the social sciences, for they cast doubt
               on our understanding of rational behaviour. This anthology, the
               first to bring together the most important philosophical essays
               on the paradoxes, analyses the concepts underlying the
               Prisoner's Dilemma and Newcomb's Problem and evaluates the
               proposed solutions. The relevant theories have been developed
               over the past four decades in a variety of disciplines:
               mathematics, economics, psychology, political science, biology,
               and philosophy. And the problems these paradoxes uncover can
               arise in many different forms: in debates over nuclear
               disarmament, labour-management disputes, marital conflicts,
               Calvinist theology, and even in the evolution of disease through
               the ``cooperation'' of microorganisms. The possibilities for
               application are virtually limitless. The introduction gives the
               uninitiated reader sufficient background to cope with the
               technical aspects of the discussions as well as to see how the
               articles are linked together in an on-going dialectic. Many of
               the essays are already considered classics in the field; others,
               not previously published, provide responses to objections that
               have been made against the authors' earlier positions. Although
               designed primarily for philosophers and philosophy students,
               Paradoxes of Rationality and Cooperation has broad implications
               for other disciplines as well as for interested non-specialists.",

               argues against this theory and in favour of evidential or

               1962, Everett Rogers's name has become ``virtually synonymous
               with the study of diffusion of innovations,'' according to
               Choice. The second and third editions of Diffusion of
               Innovations became the standard textbook and reference on
               diffusion studies. Now, in the fourth edition, Rogers presents
               the culmination of more than thirty years of research that will
               set a new standard for analysis and inquiry.The fourth edition
               is (1) a revision of the theoretical framework and the research
               evidence supporting this model of diffusion, and (2) a new
               intellectual venture, in that new concepts and new theoretical
               viewpoints are introduced. This edition differs from its
               predecessors in that it takes a much more critical stance in its
               review and synthesis of 5,000 diffusion publications. During the
               past thirty years or so, diffusion research has grown to be
               widely recognized, applied and admired, but it has also been
               subjected to both constructive and destructive criticism. This
               criticism is due in large part to the stereotyped and limited
               ways in which many diffusion scholars have defined the scope and
               method of their field of study. Rogers analyzes the limitations
               of previous diffusion studies, showing, for example, that the
               convergence model, by which participants create and share
               information to reach a mutual understanding, more accurately
               describes diffusion in most cases than the linear model. Rogers
               provides an entirely new set of case examples, from the Balinese
               Water Temple to Nintendo videogames, that beautifully illustrate
               his expansive research, as well as a completely revised
               bibliography covering all relevant diffusion scholarship in the
               past decade. Most important, he discusses recent research and
               current topics, including social marketing, forecasting the rate
               of adoption, technology transfer, and more. This all-inclusive
               work will be essential reading for scholars and students in the
               fields of communications, marketing, geography, economic
               development, political science, sociology, and other related

                 refined theory more accurately expresses the central
                 assumption of the original theory that research has largely
                 ignored: Values form a circular motivational continuum. The
                 theory defines and orders 19 values on the continuum based on
                 their compatible and conflicting motivations, expression of
                 self-protection versus growth, and personal versus social
                 focus. We assess the theory with a new instrument in 15

                 multidimensional scaling analyses support discrimination of

                 scaling analyses largely support the predicted motivational
                 order of the values. Analyses of predictive validity

               our evolutionary history, it has only been in the last three

               cognitive psychology, and paleoanthropology have made the fact
               of our evolution illuminating. Converging findings from a
               variety of disciplines are leading to the emergence of a
               fundamentally new view of the human mind, and with it a new
               framework for the behavioral and social sciences. First, with
               the advent of the cognitive revolution, human nature can finally
               be defined precisely as the set of universal, species-typical
               information-processing programs that operate beneath the surface

               cognitive programs evolved in the Pleistocene to solve the

               ancestors--problems such as mate selection, language
               acquisition, cooperation, and sexual infidelity. Consequently,

               contentful structure on human mental organization and culture.

               when the players have not thought everything out in advance,
               game theory often works for the same reason that mindless

                 each process, it is proposed that they constitute different
                 forms of traversing psychological distance. Psychological
                 distance is egocentric: Its reference point is the self in the

               genetic transmission, ways in which cultural information is
               transmitted between individuals. Despite its importance across
               the behavioral sciences and for theories of cultural evolution,
               no attempts have been made, to our knowledge, to critically
               analyze this analogy. We here aim at such detailed comparison
               and show that the fundamental role of modes of transmission in
               biology results mainly from two properties of genetic
               transmission: (1) what is transmitted generally does not
               influence the way in which it is transmitted; (2) there is a
               limited number of simple and stable modes. In culture however,
               modes of transmission generally lack these two fundamental
               properties. In particular, in culture it is often the rate of
               evolutionary change that determines the mode of transmission. We
               offer some tentative explanation regarding the origins of such a
               fundamental difference and we conclude that cultural
               transmission modes are not causal mechanisms that govern the
               transmission of culture but mere descriptions of the way culture
               happens to be transmitted at a given time in a given community.
               This shows the limit of the analogy between biological and
               cultural evolution and suggests that evolutionary models and

              selection can operate against the cheater (non-reciprocator) in
              the system. Three instances of altruistic behavior are discussed,
              the evolution of which the model can explain: (1) behavior
              involved in cleaning symbioses; (2) warning cries in birds; and
              (3) human reciprocal altruism. Regarding human reciprocal
              altruism, it is shown that the details of the psychological
              system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the
              model. Specifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression,
              gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects
              of guilt, and some forms of dishonesty and hypocrisy can be
              explained as important adaptations to regulate the altruistic
              system. Each individual human is seen as possessing altruistic
              and cheating tendencies, the expression of which is sensitive to
              developmental variables that were selected to set the tendencies
              at a balance appropriate to the local social and ecological

               among independent, self-interested agents. The audience for game
               theory has grown dramatically in recent years, and now spans
               disciplines as diverse as political science, biology,
               psychology, economics, linguistics, sociology, and computer
               science, among others. What has been missing is a relatively
               short introduction to the field covering the common basis that
               anyone with a professional interest in game theory is likely to
               require. Such a text would minimize notation, ruthlessly focus
               on essentials, and yet not sacrifice rigor. This Synthesis
               Lecture aims to fill this gap by providing a concise and
               accessible introduction to the field. It covers the main classes
               of games, their representations, and the main concepts used to
               analyze them.``This introduction is just what a growing
               multidisciplinary audience needs: it is concise, authoritative,
               up to date, and clear on the important conceptual issues.''

               view, by J. J. C. Smart and Bernard Williams. In the first part
               of the book Professor Smart advocates a modern and sophisticated
               version of classical utilitarianism; he tries to formulate a
               consistent and persuasive elaboration of the doctrine that the
               rightness and wrongness of actions is determined solely by their
               consequences, and in particular their consequences for the sum
               total of human happiness. In Part II Bernard Williams offers a
               sustained and vigorous critique of utilitarian assumptions,
               arguments and ideals. He finds inadequate the theory of action
               implied by utilitarianism, and he argues that utilitarianism
               fails to engage at a serious level with the real problems of
               moral and political philosophy, and fails to make sense of
               notions such as integrity, or even human happiness itself. This

               members but has developed into a consciously chosen ethic with
               an expanding circle of moral concern. Drawing on philosophy and
               evolutionary psychology, he demonstrates that human ethics
               cannot be explained by biology alone. Rather, it is our capacity
               for reasoning that makes moral progress possible. In a new
               afterword, Singer takes stock of his argument in light of recent
               research on the evolution of morality.",

                 society's future (``collective futures'') that could drive
                 political behavior in the present. In eight studies (N = 595),
                 people imagined society in 2050 where climate change was
                 mitigated (Study 1), abortion laws relaxed (Study 2),
                 marijuana legalized (Study 3), or the power of different
                 religious groups had increased (Studies 4-8). Participants
                 rated how this future society would differ from today in terms
                 of societal-level dysfunction and development (e.g., crime,
                 inequality, education, technology), people's character
                 (warmth, competence, morality), and their values (e.g.,
                 conservation, self-transcendence). These measures were related
                 to present-day attitudes/intentions that would promote/prevent
                 this future (e.g., act on climate change, vote for a Muslim
                 politician). A projection about benevolence in society (i.e.,
                 warmth/morality of people's character) was the only dimension

  abstract = "Characterizing human values is a topic deeply interwoven with the
              sciences, humanities, art, and many other human endeavors. In
              recent years, a number of thinkers have argued that accelerating
              trends in computer science, cognitive science, and related
              disciplines foreshadow the creation of intelligent machines which
              meet and ultimately surpass the cognitive abilities of human
              beings, thereby entangling an understanding of human values with
              future technological development. Contemporary research
              accomplishments suggest sophisticated AI systems becoming
              widespread and responsible for managing many aspects of the
              modern world, from preemptively planning users' travel schedules
              and logistics, to fully autonomous vehicles, to domestic robots
              assisting in daily living. The extrapolation of these trends has
              been most forcefully described in the context of a hypothetical
              ``intelligence explosion,'' in which the capabilities of an
              intelligent software agent would rapidly increase due to the
              presence of feedback loops unavailable to biological organisms.
              The possibility of superintelligent agents, or simply the
              widespread deployment of sophisticated, autonomous AI systems,
              highlights an important theoretical problem: the need to separate
              the cognitive and rational capacities of an agent from the
              fundamental goal structure, or value system, which constrains and
              guides the agent's actions. The ``value alignment problem'' is to
              specify a goal structure for autonomous agents compatible with
              human values. In this brief article, we suggest that recent ideas
              from affective neuroscience and related disciplines aimed at
              characterizing neurological and behavioral universals in the
              mammalian kingdom provide important conceptual foundations
              relevant to describing human values. We argue that the notion of
              ``mammalian value systems'' points to a potential avenue for
              fundamental research in AI safety and AI ethics.",
