               muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains. If
               machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general
               intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very
               powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us
               humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our
               species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine
               superintelligence. But we have one advantage: we get to make the
               first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or
               otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an

               of topics and considerations. Read the book and learn about
               oracles, genies, singletons; about boxing methods, tripwires,

@BOOK{Rogers2010-hg,
  title     = "Diffusion of Innovations, 4th Edition",
  author    = "Rogers, Everett M",
  abstract  = "Since the first edition of this landmark book was published in
               1962, Everett Rogers's name has become ``virtually synonymous
               with the study of diffusion of innovations,'' according to
               Choice. The second and third editions of Diffusion of
               Innovations became the standard textbook and reference on
               diffusion studies. Now, in the fourth edition, Rogers presents
               the culmination of more than thirty years of research that will
               set a new standard for analysis and inquiry.The fourth edition
               is (1) a revision of the theoretical framework and the research
               evidence supporting this model of diffusion, and (2) a new
               intellectual venture, in that new concepts and new theoretical
               viewpoints are introduced. This edition differs from its
               predecessors in that it takes a much more critical stance in its
               review and synthesis of 5,000 diffusion publications. During the
               past thirty years or so, diffusion research has grown to be
               widely recognized, applied and admired, but it has also been
               subjected to both constructive and destructive criticism. This
               criticism is due in large part to the stereotyped and limited
               ways in which many diffusion scholars have defined the scope and
               method of their field of study. Rogers analyzes the limitations
               of previous diffusion studies, showing, for example, that the
               convergence model, by which participants create and share
               information to reach a mutual understanding, more accurately
               describes diffusion in most cases than the linear model. Rogers
               provides an entirely new set of case examples, from the Balinese
               Water Temple to Nintendo videogames, that beautifully illustrate
               his expansive research, as well as a completely revised
               bibliography covering all relevant diffusion scholarship in the
               past decade. Most important, he discusses recent research and
               current topics, including social marketing, forecasting the rate
               of adoption, technology transfer, and more. This all-inclusive
               work will be essential reading for scholars and students in the
               fields of communications, marketing, geography, economic
               development, political science, sociology, and other related

                 believe they understand a concept more deeply than they
                 actually do. To date, IOEDs have been identified only in
                 mechanical and natural domains, occluding why they occur and
                 suggesting that their implications are quite limited. Six
                 studies illustrated that IOEDs occur because people adopt an
                 inappropriately abstract construal style when they assess how
                 well they understand concrete concepts. As this mechanism
                 predicts, participants who naturally adopted concrete
                 construal styles (Study 1) or were induced to adopt a concrete
                 construal style (Studies 2-4 and 6), experienced diminished
                 IOEDs. Two additional studies documented a novel IOED in the
                 social psychological domain of electoral voting (Studies 5 and
                 6), demonstrating the generality of the construal mechanism,
                 the authors also extended the presumed boundary conditions of
                 the effect beyond mechanical and natural domains. These
                 findings suggest a novel factor that might contribute to such

                 egocentrism, and the planning fallacy, where people adopt

                   The original abstract follows. This is a critical review of
                   the literature on many-worlds interpretations (MWI), with
                   arguments drawn partly from earlier critiques by Bell and
                   Stein. The essential postulates involved in various MWI are
                   extracted, and their consistency with the evident physical
                   world is examined. Arguments are presented against MWI
                   proposed by Everett, Graham and DeWitt. The relevance of
                   frequency operators to MWI is examined; it is argued that

                   Farhi-Goldstone-Gutmann do not in themselves provide a

                   neither support existing MWI nor would be useful in
                   constructing new MWI. Comments are made on papers by Geroch

               a shared space, creating conflicts of interest and clashes of
               values, along with unprecedented opportunities. As the world
               shrinks, the moral lines that divide us become more salient and
               more puzzling. We fight over everything from tax codes to gay
               marriage to global warming, and we wonder where, if at all, we
               can find our common ground.A grand synthesis of neuroscience,
               psychology, and philosophy, Moral Tribes reveals the underlying
               causes of modern conflict and lights a way forward. Our emotions
               make us social animals, turning Me into Us. But they also make
               us tribal animals, turning Us against Them. Our tribal emotions
               make us fight, sometimes with bombs, sometimes with words, and
               often with life-and-death stakes. Drawing inspiration from moral
               philosophy and cutting-edge science, Moral Tribes shows when we
               should trust our instincts, when we should reason, and how the
               right kind of reasoning can move us forward.Joshua Greene is the
               director of Harvard University's Moral Cognition Lab, a

               psychology, economics, linguistics, sociology, and computer
               science, among others. What has been missing is a relatively
               short introduction to the field covering the common basis that
               anyone with a professional interest in game theory is likely to
               require. Such a text would minimize notation, ruthlessly focus
               on essentials, and yet not sacrifice rigor. This Synthesis

  abstract  = "Modes of cultural transmission are, by analogy with modes of
               genetic transmission, ways in which cultural information is
               transmitted between individuals. Despite its importance across
               the behavioral sciences and for theories of cultural evolution,
               no attempts have been made, to our knowledge, to critically
               analyze this analogy. We here aim at such detailed comparison
               and show that the fundamental role of modes of transmission in
               biology results mainly from two properties of genetic
               transmission: (1) what is transmitted generally does not
               influence the way in which it is transmitted; (2) there is a
               limited number of simple and stable modes. In culture however,
               modes of transmission generally lack these two fundamental
               properties. In particular, in culture it is often the rate of
               evolutionary change that determines the mode of transmission. We
               offer some tentative explanation regarding the origins of such a
               fundamental difference and we conclude that cultural
               transmission modes are not causal mechanisms that govern the
               transmission of culture but mere descriptions of the way culture
               happens to be transmitted at a given time in a given community.
               This shows the limit of the analogy between biological and
               cultural evolution and suggests that evolutionary models and

               principles of rational choice. According to the usual view of
               choice, a rational person selects what is likely to give the
               greatest expectation of value or utility. But in many
               situations, if each person chooses in this way, everyone will be
               worse off than need be. Instead, Professor Gauthier proposes a
               principle whereby choice is made on an agreed basis of
               co-operation, rather than according to what would give the
               individual the greatest expectation of value. He shows that such
               a principle not only ensures mutual benefit and fairness, thus
               satisfying the standards of morality, but also that each person
               may actually expect greater utility by adhering to morality,

               argues against this theory and in favour of evidential or

               of options over their causal role. It examines a variety of

               philosophical thought-experiments, where causal knowledge seems
               to make a practical difference. The arguments make novel use of

               first-person epistemology and the free will debate. The book

               possess a sufficient level of intelligence, agents having any of
               a wide range of final goals will pursue similar intermediary
               goals because they have instrumental reasons to do so. In

              selection can operate against the cheater (non-reciprocator) in
              the system. Three instances of altruistic behavior are discussed,
              the evolution of which the model can explain: (1) behavior
              involved in cleaning symbioses; (2) warning cries in birds; and
              (3) human reciprocal altruism. Regarding human reciprocal
              altruism, it is shown that the details of the psychological
              system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the
              model. Specifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression,
              gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects
              of guilt, and some forms of dishonesty and hypocrisy can be
              explained as important adaptations to regulate the altruistic
              system. Each individual human is seen as possessing altruistic
              and cheating tendencies, the expression of which is sensitive to

  abstract  = "Humans are a puzzling species. On the one hand, we struggle to
               survive on our own in the wild, often failing to overcome even
               basic challenges, like obtaining food, building shelters, or
               avoiding predators. On the other hand, human groups have
               produced ingenious technologies, sophisticated languages, and
               complex institutions that have permitted us to successfully
               expand into a vast range of diverse environments. What has
               enabled us to dominate the globe, more than any other species,
               while remaining virtually helpless as lone individuals? This
               book shows that the secret of our success lies not in our innate
               intelligence, but in our collective brains---on the ability of
               human groups to socially interconnect and learn from one another
               over generations. Drawing insights from lost European explorers,
               clever chimpanzees, mobile hunter-gatherers, neuroscientific
               findings, ancient bones, and the human genome, Joseph Henrich
               demonstrates how our collective brains have propelled our
               species' genetic evolution and shaped our biology. Our early
               capacities for learning from others produced many cultural
               innovations, such as fire, cooking, water containers, plant
               knowledge, and projectile weapons, which in turn drove the
               expansion of our brains and altered our physiology, anatomy, and
               psychology in crucial ways. Later on, some collective brains
               generated and recombined powerful concepts, such as the lever,
               wheel, screw, and writing, while also creating the institutions
               that continue to alter our motivations and perceptions. Henrich
               shows how our genetics and biology are inextricably interwoven
               with cultural evolution, and how culture-gene interactions
               launched our species on an extraordinary evolutionary
               trajectory. Tracking clues from our ancient past to the present,
               The Secret of Our Success explores how the evolution of both our
               cultural and social natures produce a collective intelligence
               that explains both our species' immense success and the origins
               of human uniqueness.",

  abstract      = "We present a computable algorithm that assigns probabilities
                   to every logical statement in a given formal language, and
                   refines those probabilities over time. For instance, if the
                   language is Peano arithmetic, it assigns probabilities to
                   all arithmetical statements, including claims about the twin
                   prime conjecture, the outputs of long-running computations,
                   and its own probabilities. We show that our algorithm, an
                   instance of what we call a logical inductor, satisfies a
                   number of intuitive desiderata, including: (1) it learns to
                   predict patterns of truth and falsehood in logical
                   statements, often long before having the resources to
                   evaluate the statements, so long as the patterns can be
                   written down in polynomial time; (2) it learns to use
                   appropriate statistical summaries to predict sequences of
                   statements whose truth values appear pseudorandom; and (3)
                   it learns to have accurate beliefs about its own current
                   beliefs, in a manner that avoids the standard paradoxes of
                   self-reference. For example, if a given computer program
                   only ever produces outputs in a certain range, a logical
                   inductor learns this fact in a timely manner; and if late
                   digits in the decimal expansion of $\pi$ are difficult to
                   predict, then a logical inductor learns to assign $\approx
                   10\%$ probability to ``the $n$th digit of $\pi$ is a 7'' for
                   large $n$. Logical inductors also learn to trust their
                   future beliefs more than their current beliefs, and their
                   beliefs are coherent in the limit (whenever $\phi \implies
                   \psi$, $\mathbb\{P\}_\infty(\phi) \le
                   \mathbb\{P\}_\infty(\psi)$, and so on); and logical
                   inductors strictly dominate the universal semimeasure in the
                   limit. These properties and many others all follow from a
                   single logical induction criterion, which is motivated by a
                   series of stock trading analogies. Roughly speaking, each
                   logical sentence $\phi$ is associated with a stock that is

               classic exposition of evolutionary thought. Professor Dawkins

               centre stage to these persistent units of information, and in
               which organisms can be seen as vehicles for their replication.

               is playing a bargaining game. The opposing candidates in an
               election are playing a political game. The supermarket's price
               for corn flakes is decided by playing an economic game. Game
               theory is about how to play such games in a rational way. Even
               when the players have not thought everything out in advance,
               game theory often works for the same reason that mindless

               forces eliminate irrational play because it is unfit. Game
               theory has seen spectacular successes in evolutionary biology

               disciplines from psychology to political science. This Very

  abstract  = "Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this
               book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of
               causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous
               concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications
               in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics,
               philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social
               sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic,
               manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to
               causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the
               relationships between causal connections and statistical
               associations. The book will open the way for including causal
               analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial
               intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and
               economics. Students in these fields will find natural models,
               simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical
               definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have
               evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of
               Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that
               causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer
               science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000
               scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists
               from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this
               revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers
               readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent
               advances in this field of research. Causality will be of
               interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of
               fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships
               from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess
               explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal
               understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating

               contented themselves with specifying a single numerical payoff
               function for each player. They do so without any consideration
               of the units in which utility is measured, or what alternative
               profiles of payoff functions can be regarded as equivalent. This
               paper will have succeeded if it leaves the reader with the
               impression that considering such measurement issues can
               considerably enrich our understanding of the decision-theoretic
               foundations of game theory. A useful byproduct is identifying
               which games can be treated as equivalent to especially simple
               games, such as two-person zero-sum games, or team games.
               Finally, it is pointed out that the usual utility concepts in
               single-person decision theory can be derived by considering
               different players’ objectives in the whole class of
               consequentialist game forms, rather than just in one particular

                   of non-classical behavior, the prevailing view on the
                   interpretation of quantum mechanics appears to be gradually
                   changing. A (highly unscientific) poll taken at the 1997
                   UMBC quantum mechanics workshop gave the once all-dominant
                   Copenhagen interpretation less than half of the votes. The
                   Many Worlds interpretation (MWI) scored second, comfortably
                   ahead of the Consistent Histories and Bohm interpretations.
                   It is argued that since all the above-mentioned approaches
                   to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics give identical cookbook
                   prescriptions for how to calculate things in practice,
                   practical-minded experimentalists, who have traditionally
                   adopted the ``shut-up-and-calculate interpretation'',
                   typically show little interest in whether cozy classical
                   concepts are in fact real in some untestable metaphysical
                   sense or merely the way we subjectively perceive a
                   mathematically simpler world where the Schrodinger equation
                   describes everything - and that they are therefore becoming
                   less bothered by a profusion of worlds than by a profusion
                   of words. Common objections to the MWI are discussed. It is
                   argued that when environment-induced decoherence is taken
                   into account, the experimental predictions of the MWI are
                   identical to those of the Copenhagen interpretation except
                   for an experiment involving a Byzantine form of ``quantum
                   suicide''. This makes the choice between them purely a
                   matter of taste, roughly equivalent to whether one believes

                  Timeless decision theory (TDT) is an extension of causal
                  decision networks that compactly repre- sents uncertainty
                  about correlated computational processes and represents the
                  decision- maker as such a process. This simple extension
                  enables TDT to return the one-box answer for Newcomb’s
                  Problem, the causal answer in Solomon’s Problem, and mutual
                  cooperation in the one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma, for reasons
                  similar to human intuition. Furthermore, an evidential or

               paradoxes about consciousness, choice, ethics, quantum
               mechanics, and other topics, in an effort to reconcile a purely
               mechanical view of the universe with key aspects of our
               subjective impressions of our own existence. Many scientists
               suspect that the universe can ultimately be described by a
               simple (perhaps even deterministic) formalism; all that is real
               unfolds mechanically according to that formalism. But how, then,
               is it possible for us to be conscious, or to make genuine
               choices? And how can there be an ethical dimension to such
               choices? Drescher sketches computational models of
               consciousness, choice, and subjunctive reasoning -- what would
               happen if this or that were to occur? -- to show how such
               phenomena are compatible with a mechanical, even deterministic
               universe. Analyses of Newcomb's Problem (a paradox about choice)
               and the Prisoner's Dilemma (a paradox about self-interest vs.
               altruism, arguably reducible to Newcomb's Problem) help bring
               the problems and proposed solutions into focus. Regarding
               quantum mechanics, Drescher builds on Everett's relative-state
               formulation -- but presenting a simplified formalism, accessible
               to laypersons -- to argue that, contrary to some popular
               impressions, quantum mechanics is compatible with an objective,
               deterministic physical reality, and that there is no special
               connection between quantum phenomena and consciousness. In each
               of several disparate but intertwined topics ranging from physics
               to ethics, Drescher argues that a missing technical linchpin can
               make the quest for objectivity seem impossible, until the
               elusive technical fix is at hand.",

              sciences, humanities, art, and many other human endeavors. In
              recent years, a number of thinkers have argued that accelerating
              trends in computer science, cognitive science, and related
              disciplines foreshadow the creation of intelligent machines which
              meet and ultimately surpass the cognitive abilities of human
              beings, thereby entangling an understanding of human values with
              future technological development. Contemporary research
              accomplishments suggest sophisticated AI systems becoming
              widespread and responsible for managing many aspects of the
              modern world, from preemptively planning users' travel schedules
              and logistics, to fully autonomous vehicles, to domestic robots
              assisting in daily living. The extrapolation of these trends has
              been most forcefully described in the context of a hypothetical
              ``intelligence explosion,'' in which the capabilities of an
              intelligent software agent would rapidly increase due to the
              presence of feedback loops unavailable to biological organisms.
              The possibility of superintelligent agents, or simply the
              widespread deployment of sophisticated, autonomous AI systems,
              highlights an important theoretical problem: the need to separate
              the cognitive and rational capacities of an agent from the
              fundamental goal structure, or value system, which constrains and
              guides the agent's actions. The ``value alignment problem'' is to
              specify a goal structure for autonomous agents compatible with
              human values. In this brief article, we suggest that recent ideas
              from affective neuroscience and related disciplines aimed at
              characterizing neurological and behavioral universals in the
              mammalian kingdom provide important conceptual foundations
              relevant to describing human values. We argue that the notion of
              ``mammalian value systems'' points to a potential avenue for
              fundamental research in AI safety and AI ethics.",

  abstract  = "It has often been suggested that people's ordinary understanding
               of morality involves a belief in objective moral truths and a
               rejection of moral relativism. The results of six studies call
               this claim into question. Participants did offer apparently
               objectivist moral intuitions when considering individuals from
               their own culture, but they offered increasingly relativist
               intuitions considering individuals from increasingly different
               cultures or ways of life. The authors hypothesize that people do
               not have a fixed commitment to moral objectivism but instead
               tend to adopt different views depending on the degree to which
               they consider radically different perspectives on moral
               questions.",

  abstract      = "This paper sets out to solve the Sleeping Beauty problem and
                   various related anthropic (self-locating belief) problems,
                   not through the calculation of anthropic probabilities, but
                   through finding the correct decision to make. Given certain
                   simple assumptions, it turns out to be possible to do so
                   without knowing the underlying anthropic probabilities. Most
                   common anthropic problems are underspecified from the
                   decision perspective, and this can explain some of the
                   differing intuitions in the subject: selfless and selfish
                   agents, total and average utilitarians, will all reach
                   different decisions in the same problem. These results are
                   formalised into an anthropic decision theory, that is then
                   used to solve many anthropic problems and paradoxes, such as
                   the Presumptuous Philosopher, Adam and Eve, and Doomsday
