                   necessary for aligning smarter-than-human artificial systems

                   standard formulations of decision theory, and demonstrate
                   that they cannot be used to describe an idealized decision
                   procedure suitable for approximation by artificial systems.
                   We then explore the notions of policy selection and logical
                   counterfactuals, two recent insights into decision theory
                   that point the way toward promising paths for future

@article{Lord1979-sc,
	Abstract = {People who hold strong opinions on complex social issues are
               likely to examine relevant empirical evidence in a biased
               manner. They are apt to accept ``confirming'' evidence at face
               value while subjecting ``disconfirming'' evidence to critical
               evaluation, and, as a result, draw undue support for their
               initial positions from mixed or random empirical findings. Thus,
               the result of exposing contending factions in a social dispute
               to an identical body of relevant empirical evidence may be not a
               narrowing of disagreement but rather an increase in
               polarization. To test these assumptions, 48 undergraduates
               supporting and opposing capital punishment were exposed to 2
               purported studies, one seemingly confirming and one seemingly
               disconfirming their existing beliefs about the deterrent
               efficacy of the death penalty. As predicted, both proponents and
               opponents of capital punishment rated those results and
               procedures that confirmed their own beliefs to be the more
               convincing and probative ones, and they reported corresponding
               shifts in their beliefs as the various results and procedures
               were presented. The net effect of such evaluations and opinion
               shifts was the postulated increase in attitude polarization. (28

                   successes are mixed with outstanding puzzles and promises of
                   new technologies. This article reviews both the successes of
                   quantum theory and the ongoing debate about its consequences
                   for issues ranging from quantum computation to
                   consciousness, parallel universes and the nature of physical
                   reality. We argue that modern experiments and the discovery
                   of decoherence have have shifted prevailing quantum
                   interpretations away from wave function collapse towards
                   unitary physics, and discuss quantum processes in the
                   framework of a tripartite subject-object-environment

@book{Greene2013-sq,
	Abstract = {Our brains were designed for tribal life, for getting along with
               a select group of others (Us), and for fighting off everyone
               else (Them). But modern life has thrust the world's tribes into
               a shared space, creating conflicts of interest and clashes of
               values, along with unprecedented opportunities. As the world
               shrinks, the moral lines that divide us become more salient and
               more puzzling. We fight over everything from tax codes to gay
               marriage to global warming, and we wonder where, if at all, we
               can find our common ground.A grand synthesis of neuroscience,
               psychology, and philosophy, Moral Tribes reveals the underlying
               causes of modern conflict and lights a way forward. Our emotions
               make us social animals, turning Me into Us. But they also make
               us tribal animals, turning Us against Them. Our tribal emotions
               make us fight, sometimes with bombs, sometimes with words, and
               often with life-and-death stakes. Drawing inspiration from moral
               philosophy and cutting-edge science, Moral Tribes shows when we
               should trust our instincts, when we should reason, and how the
               right kind of reasoning can move us forward.Joshua Greene is the
               director of Harvard University's Moral Cognition Lab, a
               pioneering scientist, a philosopher, and an acclaimed teacher.
               The great challenge of Moral Tribes is this: How can we get
               along with Them when what they want feels so wrong? Finally,
               Greene offers a surprisingly simple set of maxims for navigating
               the modern moral terrain, a practical road map for solving
               problems and living better lives.},

@article{Torelli2009-mw,
	Abstract = {This research makes strides toward reconciling mixed findings
                 in the value-behavior relation by positing that values are
                 abstract representations of ideal end states that are more
                 likely to influence behavior when individuals think abstractly
                 (vs. concretely) and focus on high- (vs. low-) level
                 motivations for interpreting their actions. In 6 experiments,
                 the authors measured the importance of values (or made them
                 salient via a priming procedure) and simultaneously
                 manipulated accessible mindsets (abstract vs. concrete), and
                 assessed their effect on judgments and behaviors. An abstract
                 (and not a concrete) mindset led participants to engage in
                 judgments or behaviors that were consistent with a broad range
                 of values, including power, benevolence, universalism,
                 self-direction, individualism, and collectivism. These results
                 support the notion that values are more likely to be expressed
                 through value-congruent judgments and behaviors when
                 individuals think abstractly about their actions, and not when
                 they think concretely. Two of the experiments examined the
                 process underlying these effects.},

	Abstract = {A short foreword has been added for the archive version of
                   this article, which otherwise appears as originally
                   published in 1990, except for the updating of references.
                   The original abstract follows. This is a critical review of
                   the literature on many-worlds interpretations (MWI), with
                   arguments drawn partly from earlier critiques by Bell and
                   Stein. The essential postulates involved in various MWI are
                   extracted, and their consistency with the evident physical
                   world is examined. Arguments are presented against MWI
                   proposed by Everett, Graham and DeWitt. The relevance of
                   frequency operators to MWI is examined; it is argued that
                   frequency operator theorems of Hartle and
                   Farhi-Goldstone-Gutmann do not in themselves provide a
                   probability interpretation for quantum mechanics, and thus
                   neither support existing MWI nor would be useful in
                   constructing new MWI. Comments are made on papers by Geroch
                   and Deutsch that advocate MWI. It is concluded that no
                   plausible set of axioms exists for an MWI that describes
                   known physics.},

               criterion consistent with rationality. On the other hand, the
               Bayesian criterion, together with the Pareto optimality
               requirement, inescapably entails a utilitarian theory of
               morality. The next sections discuss the role both of cardinal
               utility and of cardinal interpersonal comparisons of utility in
               ethics. It is shown that the utilitarian welfare function

               celebrated impossibility theorem by making use of information
               which is unavailable in Arrow's original framework. Finally,

               self-select the source of the arguments they read. Both the

               survive on our own in the wild, often failing to overcome even
               basic challenges, like obtaining food, building shelters, or
               avoiding predators. On the other hand, human groups have
               produced ingenious technologies, sophisticated languages, and
               complex institutions that have permitted us to successfully
               expand into a vast range of diverse environments. What has
               enabled us to dominate the globe, more than any other species,
               while remaining virtually helpless as lone individuals? This
               book shows that the secret of our success lies not in our innate
               intelligence, but in our collective brains---on the ability of
               human groups to socially interconnect and learn from one another
               over generations. Drawing insights from lost European explorers,
               clever chimpanzees, mobile hunter-gatherers, neuroscientific
               findings, ancient bones, and the human genome, Joseph Henrich
               demonstrates how our collective brains have propelled our
               species' genetic evolution and shaped our biology. Our early
               capacities for learning from others produced many cultural
               innovations, such as fire, cooking, water containers, plant
               knowledge, and projectile weapons, which in turn drove the
               expansion of our brains and altered our physiology, anatomy, and
               psychology in crucial ways. Later on, some collective brains
               generated and recombined powerful concepts, such as the lever,
               wheel, screw, and writing, while also creating the institutions
               that continue to alter our motivations and perceptions. Henrich
               shows how our genetics and biology are inextricably interwoven
               with cultural evolution, and how culture-gene interactions
               launched our species on an extraordinary evolutionary
               trajectory. Tracking clues from our ancient past to the present,
               The Secret of Our Success explores how the evolution of both our
               cultural and social natures produce a collective intelligence
               that explains both our species' immense success and the origins

              invited to imagine a society in 2050 where most individuals

                 believe they understand a concept more deeply than they
                 actually do. To date, IOEDs have been identified only in
                 mechanical and natural domains, occluding why they occur and
                 suggesting that their implications are quite limited. Six
                 studies illustrated that IOEDs occur because people adopt an
                 inappropriately abstract construal style when they assess how
                 well they understand concrete concepts. As this mechanism
                 predicts, participants who naturally adopted concrete
                 construal styles (Study 1) or were induced to adopt a concrete
                 construal style (Studies 2-4 and 6), experienced diminished
                 IOEDs. Two additional studies documented a novel IOED in the

                 the authors also extended the presumed boundary conditions of

               choices? Drescher sketches computational models of
               consciousness, choice, and subjunctive reasoning -- what would
               happen if this or that were to occur? -- to show how such
               phenomena are compatible with a mechanical, even deterministic
               universe. Analyses of Newcomb's Problem (a paradox about choice)
               and the Prisoner's Dilemma (a paradox about self-interest vs.
               altruism, arguably reducible to Newcomb's Problem) help bring
               the problems and proposed solutions into focus. Regarding
               quantum mechanics, Drescher builds on Everett's relative-state
               formulation -- but presenting a simplified formalism, accessible
               to laypersons -- to argue that, contrary to some popular
               impressions, quantum mechanics is compatible with an objective,
               deterministic physical reality, and that there is no special
               connection between quantum phenomena and consciousness. In each
               of several disparate but intertwined topics ranging from physics
               to ethics, Drescher argues that a missing technical linchpin can
               make the quest for objectivity seem impossible, until the
               elusive technical fix is at hand.},

	Abstract = {As cutting-edge experiments display ever more extreme forms
                   of non-classical behavior, the prevailing view on the
                   interpretation of quantum mechanics appears to be gradually
                   changing. A (highly unscientific) poll taken at the 1997
                   UMBC quantum mechanics workshop gave the once all-dominant
                   Copenhagen interpretation less than half of the votes. The
                   Many Worlds interpretation (MWI) scored second, comfortably
                   ahead of the Consistent Histories and Bohm interpretations.
                   It is argued that since all the above-mentioned approaches
                   to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics give identical cookbook
                   prescriptions for how to calculate things in practice,
                   practical-minded experimentalists, who have traditionally
                   adopted the ``shut-up-and-calculate interpretation'',
                   typically show little interest in whether cozy classical
                   concepts are in fact real in some untestable metaphysical
                   sense or merely the way we subjectively perceive a
                   mathematically simpler world where the Schrodinger equation
                   describes everything - and that they are therefore becoming
                   less bothered by a profusion of worlds than by a profusion
                   of words. Common objections to the MWI are discussed. It is
                   argued that when environment-induced decoherence is taken
                   into account, the experimental predictions of the MWI are
                   identical to those of the Copenhagen interpretation except
                   for an experiment involving a Byzantine form of ``quantum
                   suicide''. This makes the choice between them purely a
                   matter of taste, roughly equivalent to whether one believes
                   mathematical language or human language to be more

                  its goals. If so, and if the AI's goals differ from ours,
                  then this could be dis- astrous for humans. One proposed

	Abstract = {We're all hypocrites. Why? Hypocrisy is the natural state of the
               human mind. Robert Kurzban shows us that the key to
               understanding our behavioral inconsistencies lies in
               understanding the mind's design. The human mind consists of many
               specialized units designed by the process of evolution by
               natural selection. While these modules sometimes work together
               seamlessly, they don't always, resulting in impossibly
               contradictory beliefs, vacillations between patience and
               impulsiveness, violations of our supposed moral principles, and
               overinflated views of ourselves. This modular, evolutionary
               psychological view of the mind undermines deeply held intuitions
               about ourselves, as well as a range of scientific theories that
               require a ``self'' with consistent beliefs and preferences.
               Modularity suggests that there is no ``I.'' Instead, each of us
               is a contentious ``we''--a collection of discrete but
               interacting systems whose constant conflicts shape our
               interactions with one another and our experience of the world.
               In clear language, full of wit and rich in examples, Kurzban
               explains the roots and implications of our inconsistent minds,

	Abstract = {The Evolution of Cooperation provides valuable insights into the
               age-old question of whether unforced cooperation is ever
               possible. Widely praised and much-discussed, this classic book
               explores how cooperation can emerge in a world of self-seeking
               egoists-whether superpowers, businesses, or individuals-when
               there is no central authority to police their actions. The
               problem of cooperation is central to many different fields.
               Robert Axelrod recounts the famous computer tournaments in which
               the ``cooperative'' program Tit for Tat recorded its stunning
               victories, explains its application to a broad spectrum of
               subjects, and suggests how readers can both apply cooperative

	Abstract = {Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this
               book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of
               causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous
               concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications
               in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics,
               philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social
               sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic,
               manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to
               causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the
               relationships between causal connections and statistical
               associations. The book will open the way for including causal
               analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial
               intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and
               economics. Students in these fields will find natural models,
               simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical
               definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have
               evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of
               Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that
               causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer
               science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000
               scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists
               from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this
               revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers
               readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent
               advances in this field of research. Causality will be of
               interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of
               fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships
               from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess
               explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal
               understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating

@book{Campbell1985-sx,
	Abstract = {The Prisoner's Dilemma is a famous problem in game theory. In
               its simplest form, two players are faced with independent
               choices: to cooperate or not to cooperate. Each does better if
               both cooperate than if neither does; but each does better if he
               does not cooperate whatever the other does. The outcome of their
               choice can be the difference between life and death.
               Philosophers see this problem as an abstact model of the classic
               conflict between self-interest and a socially advantageous moral
               order. Some philosophers have argued that it is a special case
               of Newcomb's Problem, technically a puzzle in mathematical
               decision theory. There is a deep division amongst philosophers
               over the nature and extent of the relationship between these two
               dilemmas. Both, however, threaten the foundations of ethical and
               political theory, even the social sciences, for they cast doubt
               on our understanding of rational behaviour. This anthology, the
               first to bring together the most important philosophical essays
               on the paradoxes, analyses the concepts underlying the
               Prisoner's Dilemma and Newcomb's Problem and evaluates the
               proposed solutions. The relevant theories have been developed
               over the past four decades in a variety of disciplines:
               mathematics, economics, psychology, political science, biology,
               and philosophy. And the problems these paradoxes uncover can
               arise in many different forms: in debates over nuclear
               disarmament, labour-management disputes, marital conflicts,
               Calvinist theology, and even in the evolution of disease through
               the ``cooperation'' of microorganisms. The possibilities for
               application are virtually limitless. The introduction gives the
               uninitiated reader sufficient background to cope with the
               technical aspects of the discussions as well as to see how the
               articles are linked together in an on-going dialectic. Many of
               the essays are already considered classics in the field; others,
               not previously published, provide responses to objections that
               have been made against the authors' earlier positions. Although
               designed primarily for philosophers and philosophy students,
               Paradoxes of Rationality and Cooperation has broad implications
               for other disciplines as well as for interested non-specialists.},

	Abstract = {Since the first edition of this landmark book was published in
               1962, Everett Rogers's name has become ``virtually synonymous
               with the study of diffusion of innovations,'' according to
               Choice. The second and third editions of Diffusion of
               Innovations became the standard textbook and reference on
               diffusion studies. Now, in the fourth edition, Rogers presents
               the culmination of more than thirty years of research that will
               set a new standard for analysis and inquiry.The fourth edition
               is (1) a revision of the theoretical framework and the research
               evidence supporting this model of diffusion, and (2) a new
               intellectual venture, in that new concepts and new theoretical
               viewpoints are introduced. This edition differs from its
               predecessors in that it takes a much more critical stance in its
               review and synthesis of 5,000 diffusion publications. During the
               past thirty years or so, diffusion research has grown to be
               widely recognized, applied and admired, but it has also been
               subjected to both constructive and destructive criticism. This
               criticism is due in large part to the stereotyped and limited
               ways in which many diffusion scholars have defined the scope and
               method of their field of study. Rogers analyzes the limitations
               of previous diffusion studies, showing, for example, that the
               convergence model, by which participants create and share
               information to reach a mutual understanding, more accurately
               describes diffusion in most cases than the linear model. Rogers
               provides an entirely new set of case examples, from the Balinese
               Water Temple to Nintendo videogames, that beautifully illustrate
               his expansive research, as well as a completely revised

	Abstract = {The best-known argument for Evidential Decision Theory (EDT) is
               the `Why ain'cha rich?' challenge to rival Causal Decision
               Theory (CDT). The basis for this challenge is that in
               Newcomb-like situations, acts that conform to EDT may be known
               in advance to have the better return than acts that conform to
               CDT. Frank Arntzenius has recently proposed an ingenious counter
               argument, based on an example in which, he claims, it is
               predictable in advance that acts that conform to EDT will do
               less well than acts that conform to CDT. We raise two objections
               to Arntzenius's example. We argue, first, that the example is
               subtly incoherent, in a way that undermines its effectiveness
               against EDT; and, second, that the example relies on calculating
               the average return over an inappropriate population of acts.},

	Abstract = {We propose a refined theory of basic individual values
                 intended to provide greater heuristic and explanatory power
                 than the original theory of 10 values (Schwartz, 1992). The
                 refined theory more accurately expresses the central
                 assumption of the original theory that research has largely
                 ignored: Values form a circular motivational continuum. The
                 theory defines and orders 19 values on the continuum based on
                 their compatible and conflicting motivations, expression of
                 self-protection versus growth, and personal versus social
                 focus. We assess the theory with a new instrument in 15
                 samples from 10 countries (N = 6,059). Confirmatory factor and
                 multidimensional scaling analyses support discrimination of
                 the 19 values, confirming the refined theory. Multidimensional
                 scaling analyses largely support the predicted motivational
                 order of the values. Analyses of predictive validity
                 demonstrate that the refined values theory provides greater
                 and more precise insight into the value underpinnings of
                 beliefs. Each value correlates uniquely with external

	Abstract = {Although researchers have long been aware that the
               species-typical architecture of the human mind is the product of
               our evolutionary history, it has only been in the last three
               decades that advances in such fields as evolutionary biology,
               cognitive psychology, and paleoanthropology have made the fact
               of our evolution illuminating. Converging findings from a
               variety of disciplines are leading to the emergence of a
               fundamentally new view of the human mind, and with it a new
               framework for the behavioral and social sciences. First, with
               the advent of the cognitive revolution, human nature can finally
               be defined precisely as the set of universal, species-typical
               information-processing programs that operate beneath the surface
               of expressed cultural variability. Second, this collection of
               cognitive programs evolved in the Pleistocene to solve the
               adaptive problems regularly faced by our hunter-gatherer
               ancestors--problems such as mate selection, language
               acquisition, cooperation, and sexual infidelity. Consequently,
               the traditional view of the mind as a general-purpose computer,
               tabula rasa, or passive recipient of culture is being replaced
               by the view that the mind resembles an intricate network of
               functionally specialized computers, each of which imposes
               contentful structure on human mental organization and culture.
               The Adapted Mind explores this new approach--evolutionary
               psychology--and its implications for a new view of culture.},

                 each process, it is proposed that they constitute different
                 forms of traversing psychological distance. Psychological
                 distance is egocentric: Its reference point is the self in the

	Abstract = {Modes of cultural transmission are, by analogy with modes of
               genetic transmission, ways in which cultural information is
               transmitted between individuals. Despite its importance across
               the behavioral sciences and for theories of cultural evolution,
               no attempts have been made, to our knowledge, to critically
               analyze this analogy. We here aim at such detailed comparison
               and show that the fundamental role of modes of transmission in
               biology results mainly from two properties of genetic
               transmission: (1) what is transmitted generally does not
               influence the way in which it is transmitted; (2) there is a
               limited number of simple and stable modes. In culture however,
               modes of transmission generally lack these two fundamental
               properties. In particular, in culture it is often the rate of

               offer some tentative explanation regarding the origins of such a
               fundamental difference and we conclude that cultural
               transmission modes are not causal mechanisms that govern the
               transmission of culture but mere descriptions of the way culture
               happens to be transmitted at a given time in a given community.
               This shows the limit of the analogy between biological and
               cultural evolution and suggests that evolutionary models and
               theories differ substantially between the two domains.},

               animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our
               species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger
               muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains. If
               machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general
               intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very
               powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us
               humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our
               species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine
               superintelligence. But we have one advantage: we get to make the
               first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or
               otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an
               intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a
               controlled detonation? To get closer to an answer to this
               question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape
               of topics and considerations. Read the book and learn about
               oracles, genies, singletons; about boxing methods, tripwires,
               and mind crime; about humanity's cosmic endowment and

               forbiddingly difficult intellectual terrain. Yet the writing is
               so lucid that it somehow makes it all seem easy. After an
               utterly engrossing journey that takes us to the frontiers of
               thinking about the human condition and the future of intelligent

              selection can operate against the cheater (non-reciprocator) in
              the system. Three instances of altruistic behavior are discussed,
              the evolution of which the model can explain: (1) behavior
              involved in cleaning symbioses; (2) warning cries in birds; and
              (3) human reciprocal altruism. Regarding human reciprocal
              altruism, it is shown that the details of the psychological
              system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the
              model. Specifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression,
              gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects

               disciplines as diverse as political science, biology,
               psychology, economics, linguistics, sociology, and computer
               science, among others. What has been missing is a relatively
               short introduction to the field covering the common basis that
               anyone with a professional interest in game theory is likely to
               require. Such a text would minimize notation, ruthlessly focus
               on essentials, and yet not sacrifice rigor. This Synthesis
               Lecture aims to fill this gap by providing a concise and
               accessible introduction to the field. It covers the main classes
               of games, their representations, and the main concepts used to
               analyze them.``This introduction is just what a growing

               view, by J. J. C. Smart and Bernard Williams. In the first part
               of the book Professor Smart advocates a modern and sophisticated
               version of classical utilitarianism; he tries to formulate a
               consistent and persuasive elaboration of the doctrine that the
               rightness and wrongness of actions is determined solely by their
               consequences, and in particular their consequences for the sum
               total of human happiness. In Part II Bernard Williams offers a
               sustained and vigorous critique of utilitarian assumptions,
               arguments and ideals. He finds inadequate the theory of action
               implied by utilitarianism, and he argues that utilitarianism
               fails to engage at a serious level with the real problems of
               moral and political philosophy, and fails to make sense of
               notions such as integrity, or even human happiness itself. This

               et al. (Mind 113:251--283, 2004) present cases in which agents
               who cannot bind themselves are driven by standard decision
               theory to choose sequences of actions with disastrous
               consequences. They defend standard decision theory by arguing
               that if a decision rule leads agents to disaster only when they
               cannot bind themselves, this should not be taken to be a mark
               against the decision rule. I show that this claim has surprising
               implications for a number of other debates in decision theory. I
               then assess the plausibility of this claim, and suggest that it

               social action and the preferences and aspirations of society's
               members. Professor Sen's approach is based on the assumption
               that the problem of collective choice cannot be satisfactorily
               discussed within the confines of economics. While collective
               choice forms a crucial aspect of economics, the subject pertains
               also to political science, the theory of the state, and to the
               theory of decision procedures. The author has therefore used
               material from these disciplines, plus philosophical aspects from
               ethics and the theory of justice.},

               based on emotions, reason, or some innate sense of right and
               wrong? For many scientists, the key lies entirely in
               biology--especially in Darwinian theories of evolution and
               self-preservation. But if evolution is a struggle for survival,
               why are we still capable of altruism? In his classic study The
               Expanding Circle, Peter Singer argues that altruism began as a
               genetically based drive to protect one's kin and community
               members but has developed into a consciously chosen ethic with
               an expanding circle of moral concern. Drawing on philosophy and
               evolutionary psychology, he demonstrates that human ethics
               cannot be explained by biology alone. Rather, it is our capacity
               for reasoning that makes moral progress possible. In a new
               afterword, Singer takes stock of his argument in light of recent
               research on the evolution of morality.},

                 society's future (``collective futures'') that could drive
                 political behavior in the present. In eight studies (N = 595),
                 people imagined society in 2050 where climate change was
                 mitigated (Study 1), abortion laws relaxed (Study 2),
                 marijuana legalized (Study 3), or the power of different
                 religious groups had increased (Studies 4-8). Participants
                 rated how this future society would differ from today in terms
                 of societal-level dysfunction and development (e.g., crime,
                 inequality, education, technology), people's character
                 (warmth, competence, morality), and their values (e.g.,
                 conservation, self-transcendence). These measures were related
                 to present-day attitudes/intentions that would promote/prevent
                 this future (e.g., act on climate change, vote for a Muslim
                 politician). A projection about benevolence in society (i.e.,
                 warmth/morality of people's character) was the only dimension

@article{noauthor_undated-wg,
	Abstract = {Characterizing human values is a topic deeply interwoven with the
              sciences, humanities, art, and many other human endeavors. In
              recent years, a number of thinkers have argued that accelerating
              trends in computer science, cognitive science, and related
              disciplines foreshadow the creation of intelligent machines which
              meet and ultimately surpass the cognitive abilities of human
              beings, thereby entangling an understanding of human values with
              future technological development. Contemporary research
              accomplishments suggest sophisticated AI systems becoming
              widespread and responsible for managing many aspects of the
              modern world, from preemptively planning users' travel schedules
              and logistics, to fully autonomous vehicles, to domestic robots
              assisting in daily living. The extrapolation of these trends has
              been most forcefully described in the context of a hypothetical
              ``intelligence explosion,'' in which the capabilities of an
              intelligent software agent would rapidly increase due to the
              presence of feedback loops unavailable to biological organisms.
              The possibility of superintelligent agents, or simply the
              widespread deployment of sophisticated, autonomous AI systems,
              highlights an important theoretical problem: the need to separate
              the cognitive and rational capacities of an agent from the
              fundamental goal structure, or value system, which constrains and
              guides the agent's actions. The ``value alignment problem'' is to
              specify a goal structure for autonomous agents compatible with
              human values. In this brief article, we suggest that recent ideas
              from affective neuroscience and related disciplines aimed at
              characterizing neurological and behavioral universals in the
              mammalian kingdom provide important conceptual foundations
              relevant to describing human values. We argue that the notion of
              ``mammalian value systems'' points to a potential avenue for
              fundamental research in AI safety and AI ethics.},
